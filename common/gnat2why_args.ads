package Gnat2Why_Args is

   --  This package defines and initializes extra options of gnat2why, that are
   --  not relevant to the GNAT frontend. It defines both the reading and the
   --  writing of these extra options. There are two ways to use it, depending
   --  on whether you are on the reading side (gnat2why) or the writing side
   --  (gnatprove).

   --  For reading the extra options, simply call "init". Now the global
   --  variables defined at the beginning of this package are set corresponding
   --  to the extra options.

   --  For writing extra options, set the global variables to the required
   --  values, and call "Set".

   --  These extra options are stored in a file that is passed to gnat2why
   --  using the extra switch "-gnates=<file>". See the body of this package
   --  for the format of this file, the spec only describes what is needed for
   --  interfacing.
