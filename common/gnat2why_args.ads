package Gnat2Why_Args is

   --  This package defines and initializes extra options of gnat2why, that are
   --  not relevant to the GNAT frontend. It defines both the reading and the
   --  writing of these extra options. There are two ways to use it, depending
   --  on whether you are on the reading side (gnat2why) or the writing side
   --  (gnatprove).

   --  For reading the extra options, simply call "init". Now the global
   --  variables defined at the beginning of this package are set corresponding
   --  to the extra options.

   --  For writing extra options, set the global variables to the required
   --  values, and call "Set".

   --  These extra options are stored in a file that is passed to gnat2why
   --  using the extra switch "-gnates=<file>". See the body of this package
   --  for the format of this file, the spec only describes what is needed for
   --  interfacing.

   --  Name of the object sub-directory in which files are generated by
   --  GNATprove.

   -- Options defined in this package --
   -------------------------------------

   --  Warning mode for gnat2why. This is identical to Opt.Warning_Mode for the
   --  compiler. We duplicate this type here to avoid a dependency on compiler
   --  units.

   type SPARK_Warning_Mode_Type is (SW_Suppress, SW_Normal, SW_Treat_As_Error);

   Warning_Mode : SPARK_Warning_Mode_Type := SW_Treat_As_Error;

   --  Global generation mode. In this mode, gnat2why generates cross-reference
   --  information in ALI files about globals accessed by subprograms.

   Global_Gen_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  SPARK 2014 checking mode. In this mode, gnat2why checks that code marked
   --  with SPARK_Mode => True does not violate SPARK 2014 rules.

   Check_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  Check All mode. In this mode, gnat2why will do flow analysis but only
   --  report check related messages.

   Check_All_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  Flow Analysis mode. In this mode, gnat2why will do only flow analysis

   Flow_Analysis_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  Prove mode. In this mode gnat2why will also perform flow analysis, but
   --  only report soundness-related messages. Note that Flow_Analysis_Mode and
   --  Prove_Mode are mutually exclusive.

   Prove_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  Enable basic debugging for gnat2why. This will dump the CFG and PDG is
   --  dot format, and print the gnatwhy3 command line.

   Debug_Mode : Boolean := False;

   --  This will enable additional tracing output and will call graphviz on
   --  each dumped graph.

   --  The SPARK RM does not make global contracts optional, rather this is a
   --  liberty we have taken in this implementation of SPARK. This flag is
   --  controlled by the --no-global-generation switch and will make sure the

   --  default, in gnat2why we synthesize global contracts.

   --  This will show termination status (as far as flow is concerned) for each
   --  subprogram with a warning or info message.

   Flow_Termination_Proof : Boolean := False;

   --  This debug flag will show all generated contracts in a human-readable
   --  form. The main use are a few tests where we want to observe that GG is
   --  working correctly.

   --  when a function has an inconsistent contract.

   --  When Pedantic is True, issue warnings on features that could cause
   --  portability issues with other compilers than GNAT. For example, issue
   --  a warning when the Ada RM allows reassociation of operators in an
   --  expression (something GNAT never does), which could lead to different
   --  overflows, e.g. on
   --    A + B + C
   --  which is parsed as
   --    (A + B) + C
   --  but could be reassociated by another compiler as
   --    A + (B + C)

   --    GPR_All means that all VCs will be reported
