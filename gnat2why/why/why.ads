   pragma Pure;

   --  This package hierarchy provides a way to manipulate the syntax
   --  tree of a Why program and to generate some Why code out of it.

   Not_Implemented : exception;
   --  Use this exception for cases where an implementation is intended, but
   --  not done yet

   Not_Alfa        : exception;
   --  Use this exception for cases that are outside the subset defined by
   --  Alfa

   Unexpected_Node  : exception;
   --  Use this exception for cases that are not expected at this place in the
   --  Ada AST
