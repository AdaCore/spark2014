--  Translation of types

--  A single type declaration in Ada is usually translated into a list of
--  declarations in Why, grouped in a Why module. Depending on the type in
--  Ada, this list contains at least an abstract type, and several function
--  declarations for conversions.

--  For all Ada types, we have a Why type which is used to model the Ada type.
--  For all discrete types, this is "int", for all floating point types this
--  is "real", and for all array types (currently up to four dimensions)
--  there is a corresponding Why3 type for each dimension in the
--  "__gnatprove_standard.mlw" file. Record types are a bit different,
--  see below.

--  Each Ada type is modeled by a type definition in Why, plus conversion
--  functions to and from the Why model type. Operations of the type
--  are carried out on the model type, so that each operation involves a
--  conversion. Subtype or type conversions in Ada are dealt with naturally by
--  the conversion functions; converting from discrete type A to discrete type
--  B corresponds to a conversion from A to int, and from int to B.

--  See why-gen-arrays.ads for the encoding of arrays.

--  Records are a bit special because there cannot be a "universal" record
--  type in Why, as e.g. for integer types. Instead, we use Why records which
--  directly correspond to the Ada definition. All operations (i.e. field
--  accesses) are defined on the type itself. To deal with conversions between
--  records, we use the same idea as for the other Ada types. However, the
--  underlying model type now is the root type for each record type. The root
--  type is the one that has been introduced with an explicit "record ... end
--  record" scheme, as opposed to a derived type or subtype.

--  Note that the frontend differentiates between a private type and its
--  completion (two different entities), while gnat2why does not look at
--  private types and goes to the actual type (either the completion, or
--  further up if the completion is a derived type of a private type ...)

--  There is an exception to that rule, namely for private types whose
--  completion is not in SPARK. Such types *are* in SPARK, and in this
--  case gnat2why *only* looks at the private entity.

--  For more details about the different encodings, the packages
--    Why.Gen.Scalars
--    Why.Gen.Records
--    Why.Gen.Arrays
--  are useful.
