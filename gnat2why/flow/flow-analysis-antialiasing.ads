   --  out parameters is not.

   --  This procedure is aware of globals, both computed by gnat2why
   --  and specified by the user. It checks if there is:
   --     * aliasing between any two parameters
   --     * aliasing between a parameter and a global
   --     * potential aliasing between a computed global and abstract state
   --
   --  This procedure stores into a map the procedure call and its computed
   --  aliasing status.

   --  This procedure looks into the map containing information about the
   --  aliasing status for procedure call N (computed by Check_Procedure_Call).
   --  It returns the aliasing status if N has been stored in the map,
   --  Unchecked otherwise (which means that Check_Procedure_Call is not been
   --  called yet).
