--  This package deals with the detection of aliasing.

package Flow.Analysis.Antialiasing is

   procedure Check_Procedure_Call
     (FA : in out Flow_Analysis_Graphs;
      N  : Node_Id)
   with Pre => Nkind (N) in N_Entry_Call_Statement     |
                            N_Procedure_Call_Statement;
   --  This procedure looks at an entry/procedure call statement and
   --  determines if it introduces aliasing that matters: for example
   --  aliasing between in parameters is OK, but aliasing between two
   --  out parameters is not.
   --
   --  This procedure is aware of globals, both computed by gnat2why
   --  and specified. The following checks are performed:
   --     * Is there aliasing between any two parameters
   --     * Is there aliasing between a parameter and a global
   --     * Is there potential aliasing between a computed global and
   --       abstract state
