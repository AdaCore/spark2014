--  Routines that belong to flow analysis, but are applied not only to the
--  current compilation unit.

package Flow_Sanity is

   procedure Check_Incomplete_Globals;
   --  A sanity check for all translated routines, as the flow analysis only
   --  flags mismatches between Pre/Post and Global/Depends contracts for
   --  routines from the current compilation unit with bodies in SPARK;
   --  however, proof expects that the Global/Depends will introduce at least
   --  the globals referenced in Pre/Post, as otherwise we will crash with an
   --  illegal .mlw file.
