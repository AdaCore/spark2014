   --    - calls predefined procedures annotated with No_Return
   --    - has its body not in SPARK.
   --
   --    The case of a subprogram with body not SPARK needs a closer look. In
   --    fact we will need to look at calls that might come from its contracts.
   --    In particular:
   --    1) if a subprogram does not have a body yet (no .adb) then
   --       - if it does not call any subprogram in its contracts we assume it

   --       - if it does call subprograms which are nonreturning then we assume
   --         it to be nonreturning
   --       - if it does call subprograms which are returning then we assume it
   --         to terminate.
   --    2) if a subprogram is Intrinsic or Imported we can apply the same
   --       reasoning described above.
   --    3) if a subprogram has a body and this is not in SPARK then we always
   --       assume it to be nonreturning.
   --    4) if a subprogram is in a generic predefined unit then:
   --       - if the generic is instantiated with returning subprograms, we
   --         consider it to be returning
   --       - if the generic is instantiated with nonreturning subprograms, we
   --         consider it to be nonreturning.
