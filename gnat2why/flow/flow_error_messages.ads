   --  * Errors may be issued whenever a SPARK legality issue is encountered.
   --    This will happen only in SPARK checking mode and flow analysis.
   --  * Warnings may be issued for suspicious situations (e.g. unused
   --    statement), or where the tool makes assumptions.
   --  * Info messages are mainly for proved checks
   --  * Check messages are for unproved VCs, and soundness-related flow
   --    analysis messages. Checks come with a priority low, medium or high.

   --  The substitution characters used are slightly different from the
   --  standard GNAT ones defined in Errout.
   --  * Use & or % as the substitution characters, which quote the flow id
   --    with or without double quotes respectively.
   --  * Use # to insert both the quoted name of the entity, and a line
   --    reference.
   --  * Use @ to insert the sloc of the entity.
