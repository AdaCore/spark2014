   --  * Errors may be issued whenever a SPARK legality issue is encountered.
   --    This will happen only in SPARK checking mode and flow analysis.
   --  * Warnings may be issued for suspicious situations (e.g. unused
   --    statement), or where the tool makes assumptions.
   --  * Info messages are mainly for proved checks
   --  * check messages are for unproved VCs, and soundness-related flow
   --    analysis messages. Checks come with a priority low, medium or high.
