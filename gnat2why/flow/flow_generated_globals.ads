   --  -------------------------------------
   --  -- Flow_Generated_Globals Algorithm --
   --  -------------------------------------
   --
   --  This algorithm is applied to individual compilation units.
   --
   --  During the first pass:
   --
   --    * For every subprogram and task in SPARK a GG graph is created. The
   --      graph is then traversed to classify global variables as proof ins,
   --      ins and outs, and called subprograms as proof only calls, definite
   --      calls and conditional calls. Also we take note of all local
   --      variables. This info is then stored in the ALI file.
   --
   --    * For every subprogram and task that is NOT in SPARK and does NOT
   --      have a user-provided contract only GG entries and not a GG graph is
   --      created and stored in the ALI file. Those GG entries mirror the xref
   --      information that the frontend stores in the ALI file (see also
   --      Spark_Frame_Condition). For these, all subprogram calls are
   --      considered to be conditional calls and all writes to variables are
   --      considered to be read-writes (pure reads are also included in the
   --      reads of course), since the xref information only records 'reads'
   --      and 'writes'.
   --
   --    * For every package all known state abstractions and all their
   --      constituents are collected and this info is stored in the ALI file.
   --
   --    * We collect some data relevant to tasking: a set of nonblocking
   --      subprograms, instance counts, the value of Max_Queue_Length if
   --      present, etc.
   --
   --    * We collect potentially nonreturning subprograms.
   --
   --    * We also collect subprograms with the Terminating annotation.
   --
   --  During the second pass:
   --
   --    * All information stored in the ALI files during the first pass is
   --      read back.
   --
   --    * A Global Graph for the entire compilation unit is created. This
   --      graph contains only subprograms, tasks and variables; it does not
   --      contain abstract states and packages. There are 3 vertices per
   --      subprogram/task that represent the subprogram's proof inputs, inputs
   --      and outputs. Each variable is represented by a vertex.
   --
   --    * We then draw edges between those vertices based on the GG info that
   --      we read from the ALI files. For subprograms that are marked as
   --      SPARK_Mode Off or that contain illegal SPARK constructs we use the
   --      Get_Globals function instead of the GG info from the ALI files.
   --
   --    * Lastly we use the compilation unit's Global Graph and information
   --      that we have about state abstractions and their constituents to
   --      return globals appropriate to the caller's scope.

   --  -------------------------------
   --  -- Generated Globals Section --
   --  -------------------------------
   --
   --  The Generated Globals section is located at the end of the ALI file.
   --
   --  All lines with information related to the Generated Globals start
   --  with a "GG" string, and the rest of the line is a string produced by
   --  the Serialize package.
   --
   --  See type ALI_Entry in the body of this package for details. In
   --  summary we record the following information:
   --
   --  * Abstract States and their constituents
   --  * Remote abstract states
   --  * Variables and subprograms used by subprograms
   --  * Volatile variables and external state abstractions
   --  * Nonblocking subprograms
   --  * Potentially nonreturning subprograms
   --  * Subprograms with the Terminating annotation
   --  * Tasking-related information.
   --    - suspension objects that call suspends on
   --    - protected objects whose entries are called
   --    - protected objects read-locked by function calls
   --    - protected objects write-locked by procedure calls
   --    - accessed unsynchronized objects
   --    - task instances and their number (one or more)
   --    - value of Max_Queue_Length, if present on an entry
