   --  -- Flow_Computed_Globals Algorithm --
   --  -------------------------------------

   --  This algorithm is applied on a per compilation unit basis.

   --  During the first pass:
   --    * For every subprogram and task in SPARK a GG graph is created. The
   --      graph is then traversed and all global variables are classified
   --      as proof ins, ins and outs. During the traversal we also
   --      classify called subprograms as proof only calls, definite calls
   --      and conditional calls. Lastly we take note of all local
   --      variables. This info is then appended on the ALI file.
   --    * For every subprogram that is NOT in SPARK and does NOT have
   --      a user-provided contract a GG graph is NOT created. However, we
   --      do create GG entries for those subprograms in the ALI file.
   --      Those GG entries mirror the information that (Yannick's)
   --      computed globals store in the ALI file. As a result, all
   --      subprogram calls are considered to be conditional calls and all
   --      writes to variables are considered to be read-writes (pure reads
   --      are also included in the reads of course).
   --    * For every package we gather all know state abstractions and
   --      all their constituents and that info is then appended on the
   --      ALI file.

   --  During the second pass:
   --    * All information stored in the ALI files during the first
   --      pass is read back.
   --    * A Global Graph for the entire compilation unit is created.
   --      This graph contains subprograms, tasks and variables only. No
   --      abstract states and packages are present on this graph.
   --      We create 3 vertices per subprogram/task. These represent the
   --      subprogram's proof inputs, inputs and outputs. For each
   --      variable we create a single vertex that represents the
   --      variable.
   --    * We then draw edges between those vertices based on the GG
   --      info that we read from the ALI files. For subprograms that
   --      are marked as SPARK_Mode Off or that contain illegal SPARK
   --      constructs we use the Get_Globals function instead of the GG
   --      info from the ALI files.
   --    * Lastly we use the compilation unit's Global Graph and
   --      information that we have about state abstractions and their
   --      constituents to return globals relatively to the caller's
   --      scope.

   --  -------------------------------
   --  -- Generated Globals Section --
   --  -------------------------------

   --  The Generated Globals section is located at the end of the ALI file.

   --  All lines introducing information related to the Generated Globals
   --  have the string "GG" appearing in the beginning.

   --  The Generated Globals section holds two kinds of information:

   --  1) The first kind has to do with Abstract States and the
   --     constituents thereof.

   --     Information related to this kind occupy single lines and have
   --     the string "AS" immediately after "GG". Following "AS" comes
   --     the name of the Abstract State and following that are all its
   --     constituents.

   --     Example entries:
   --       GG AS test__state test__constit_1 test__constit_2
   --       GG AS test__state2
   --       GG AS test__state3 test_state2

   --  2) The second kind has to do with subprograms and tasks. For these
   --     we store the following:

   --       * the subprogram/task's name                             (S/T)
   --       * the global variables read in proof contexts only       (VP)
   --       * the global variables read    (input)                   (VI)
   --       * the global variables written (output)                  (VO)
   --       * the subprograms that are called only in proof contexts (CP)
   --       * the subprograms that are called definitely             (CD)
   --       * the subprograms that are called conditionally          (CC)
   --       * the local variables of the subprogram                  (LV)
   --       * the local subprograms of the subprogram                (LS)

   --     For an entry of the second kind to be complete/correct all of the
   --     afformentioned lines must be present (order does not matter).

   --     Example entry:
   --       GG S FA test__proc
   --       GG VP test__proof_var
   --       GG VI test__g test__g2
   --       GG VO test__g
   --       GG CP test__ghost_func_a test__ghost_func_b
   --       GG CD test__proc_2 test__proc__nested_proc
   --       GG CC test__proc_3
   --       GG LV test__proc__nested_proc__v
   --       GG LS test__proc__nested_proc__nested_proc
