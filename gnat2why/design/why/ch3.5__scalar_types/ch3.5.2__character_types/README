According to 3.5.2 (1), character types are enumeration types with at
least one of their enumeration literals being a character literal. The
description of their generation is (therefore) given in
ch3.5.1__enumeration_types.

However, in the case of standard character types (Character,
Wide_Character, Wide_Wide_Character), it is probably not necessary to
have an explicit (cumbersome) description of all literals. They will
be better modeled as abstract types with bounds. In chars.why, an
example for Standard.Character.
