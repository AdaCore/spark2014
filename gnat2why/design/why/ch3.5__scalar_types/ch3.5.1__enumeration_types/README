This describes how enumeration types can be represented in Why.
See enum.ads, proposal in enum.why, examples of use in enum_test.why.

Enumeration types:
------------------

The representation of enumeration types is similar to the one of
integer types (ch3.5.4__integer_types). Conversions of enumeration
literals to int respect the default order as defined by 3.5.1 (7),
whether it has a representation clause or not; this should ease the
implementation of 'Succ and so; should we support representation
clause, we would just generate a different implementation for 'Pos and
we would keep the default ordering for int conversions.

Subtypes:
---------

Subtypes of enumerations are represented in a similar way. A question
remains: whether we should always operate on ints or on this enum's
base type. The second strategy is shown here.

Various remarks:
----------------

For character literals, expansion should have assigned a usable
name as well. See Enum.Some_A.

3.5.1 (9) Two enumeration types defined in the same scope may use 
enumeration literals that have the same name. Enum.Name_Clash is
an example. This is not a problem in this context, as the expansion
should already have assigned unambiguous names.
