-- Detection of SPARK Entities --
---------------------------------

--  All entities from the program are marked as being in SPARK or not in SPARK.
--  Their marking status determines how they are translated to Why3 and the
--  marking order determines the order of definition in Why3.

--  An error is issued if an entity which should be in SPARK, according to the
--  applicable SPARK_Mode pragma, is not in SPARK.

--  All entities declared locally to a toplevel subprogram body are either all
--  in SPARK, and listed for translation, or not listed for translation if a
--  violation was detected in the body.
