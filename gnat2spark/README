To build gnat2spark from sources, you need to create a link gnat2spark/gnat_src
which points to the GNAT source directory, and then run "make".
This will create a directory structure under gnat2spark/install.

You can then gnat2spark with the following command:

gnat2spark -I`gnatls -v | grep adainclude` <source file>
