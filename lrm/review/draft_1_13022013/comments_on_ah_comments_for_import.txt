There is such a subtlety. 

Raise_expression is a feature discussed by the ARG (AI12-0022)
that can be used to specify an exception to be raised for assertions
(among other things).  It allows a raise to occur in expression
contexts.  This feature is being added "retroactively" to Ada 2012.

One problem here is that "discrete_" should be italicized.

The Ada RM (1.1.4(14)) says:
  If the name of any syntactic category starts with an italicized part,
  it is equivalent to the category name without the italicized part.
  The italicized part is intended to convey some semantic information.
  For example subtype_name and task_name are both equivalent to name
  alone.

with "subtype_" and "task_" in the above text italicized.

The "provide detail" todo note seems to refer to the fact that
(for reasons that are unclear to me) the definitions of these
constructs have been removed.
