Comment: SM to confirm use of GFDL with Romain. Probably ok.

Ident: SM/3
Section: Introduction
Page/para: 3/3
Comment: Are there really Aspects that are defined to support the interface between tested and proven units? - which ones?

Ident: SM/4
Section: Introduction
Page/para: 3/5
Comment: GNAT (in caps)

Ident: SM/5
Section: 1.1
Page/para: 3/7
Comment: Reword "... Given ... gives ... given" eg. replace last "given" by "specified"

Ident: SM/6
Section: 1.4
Page/para: 4/bullet 1
Comment: Typo "aspect and pragamas" -> "aspects and pragmas"

Ident: SM/7
Section: 1.4
Page/para: 4/bullet 1
Comment: We need a note somewhere that the pragmas are still to be added to the LRM.

Ident: SM/8
Section: 1.5
Page/para: 5/bullet 3
Comment: Strictly speaking, a check can't be raised, so some rewording needed here.

Ident: SM/9
Section: 1.5
Page/para: 5/last para of 1.5
Comment: Suggest you either define "formal program verification" (or maybe just "formal verification") as "formal verification of robustness properties and functional properties taken together" (similar to how "flow analysis" is defined).

Ident: SM/10
Section: General
Page/para: n/a
Comment: *Not for this draft* - ToDo: consider adding a glossary with terms such as "flow analysis" and "formal [program] verification" defined.

Ident: SM/11
Section: 1.5.1
Page/para: 5/2
Comment: Is talking about an Assume as an assertion strictly correct? Maybe this will become clearer  when the Proof Statements section has been added.

Ident: SM/12
Section: 1.5.1
Page/para: 5/final para of 1.5.1
Comment: The first sentence needs to be reworded. It could be read as saying that the tools will give a different answer depending on the platform they are run on. I know this isn't what it is supposed to say. "Note that formal verification must take account of the environment in which a program will be executed"?

Ident: SM/13
Section: 1.6
Page/para: 5/second para of 1.6
Comment: I'm not sure "invalid" is the right word. "unverified"?

Ident: SM/14
Section: 1.7.1
Page/para: 6
Comment: Suggest starting para with "Code Policies" rather than "Guidelines".

Ident: SM/15
Section: Introduction
Page/para:
Comment: Is the use of square brackets used to denote something? If not, suggest use of normal brackets.

Ident: SM/16
Section: 1.8
Page/para: 7/bullet 1
Comment: Delete "although" and start new sentence.

Ident: SM/17
Section: 1.8
Page/para: 8/bullet 4
Comment: We need to loosen this statement - we are considering not re-implementing the integrity contract.

Ident: SM/18
Section: 1.9.1
Page/para: 9/bullet 6
Comment: "tools"->"language".

Ident: SM/19
Section: 1.9.2
Page/para: 9/5
Comment: Insert "at least" before "as good as".

Ident: SM/20
Section: 1.9.3
Page/para: 10/bullet 1
Comment: How could something as specific as being an ATM system drive a code policy - other than being by virtue of a standard? Just "Server class" is ok, or maybe "Server class information systems"?

Ident: SM/21
Section: 1.9.5
Page/para: 11/2
Comment: Something wrong with grammar of first sentence.

Ident: SM/22
Section: 1.9.6
Page/para: 13/2
Comment: Do we say what this new aspect is somewhere - or is that part of the ToDo?

Ident: SM/23
Section: 1.10.1
Page/para: 14
Comment: Suggest term being defined is highlighted or italicised.

Ident: SM/24
Section: 1.11
Page/para: 15
Comment: Why "interim"?

Ident: SM/25
Section: 11.2
Page/para: 67
Comment: Number missing from legaility rule 2.

Ident: SM/26
Section: 10.1 (and elsewhere?)
Page/para: 66
Comment: Suggest we either hide Notes in the issued draft or tidy-up the language a bit "... I don't understand ..." seems a bit informal.

Ident: SM/27
Section: 9
Page/para: 63
Comment: "toolset"->"language".

Ident: SM/28
Section: A
Page/para: 75 onwards
Comment: We should include an up-to-date mapping spec if we can do so without delaying release of the document.
