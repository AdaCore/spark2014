~ AH/1 ~ General ~ General ~ I thought we were going to move to references that included section numbers to allow people to read printed copies? NB I don't mind personally but if another senior reviewer has previously suggested it we should try to do it or have a good reason for note doing it.~
~ AH/2 ~ 1.4 ~ pg4 oara 2 ~ Typo: delete "section" in "which section is specific to ..." ~
~ AH/3 ~ 1.5 ~ last para ~ This para restricts the operation of the tools by mandating an ordering but I don't think this is necessary. However, it is probably worth stating things like: flow analysis is not valid and may not be possible if the legality rules are not met. ~
~ AH/4 ~ 1.9.5 ~ Para 2, first sentence ~ Poor grammar in first sentence.~
~ AH/5 ~ 1.9.6 ~ Second bullet of the list starting "The way in which these are used are:" ~ Unclear first sentence.~
~ AH/6 ~ 1.9.6 ~ First Todo ~ The first Todo appears to contain a heading, making it look like the Todo is empty.~
~ AH/7 ~ 1.10.1 ~ Definition of inputs/outputs ~ Does this definition include globals of the subprogram? I suspect it does but as you explicitly state formal parameters are included but don't explicitly state globals then it becomes less clear.~
~ AH/8 ~ 1.10.3 ~ Bullet 3 ~ I thought we were planning on analysing fields in records independently. This requirement may therefore be relaxed. This needs discussion before making any changes.~
~ AH/9 ~ 1.10.4 ~ Bullet 1 ~ Is the consequence of this that users would always have to add "global => null" whenever an operation does not use globals? This feels like a bit of an overhead.~
~ AH/10 ~ 3.9 ~ Todo ~ The Todo contradicts the text in this section. One or the other should be removed.~
~ AH/11 ~ 5.5.3 ~ Syntax section ~ Is this Syntax section supposed to be complete? The Todo suggests it isn't. If it is supposed to be complete then "discrete_expression" needs to be defined.~
~ AH/12 ~ 6.1 ~ 2nd para ~ [SPARK] should be replaced in the reST source with |SPARK|.~
~ AH/13 ~ 6.1.2 ~ NA ~ Please consider including forward references to the sections that define Global, Depends and Contract_Cases~
~ AH/14 ~ 6.1.4 ~ Static Semantics ~ "A global_item is referenced if: It is an input or an output of the subprogram" needs to be extended to cover globals in subprograms called directly or indirectly.~
~ AH/15 ~ 6.1.4 ~ Verification rules ~ Typo: "is a analyzed" => "is analyzed"~
~ AH/16 ~ 6.1.5 ~ Language definition para 2 ~ Shouldn't we state in here "on at least one path"?~
~ AH/17 ~ 6.1.7 ~ 2nd Para  ~ Two typos corrected in this version: "If **a** call is made, directly or indirectly, to this function other than in a**n** assertion expression which is not a subtype predicate, or if the assertion policy Ignore is not selected, an error will be reported when an attempt is made to build and execute the program."~
~ AH/18 ~ 6.3.3 ~ Firsts para ~ Typo: "its its".~
~ AH/19 ~ 6.3.3 ~ General ~ I expected some mention of state refinement here. Please provide a forward reference to the relevant subsection of section 7. Nb this comment also applies to section 6.3.4.~
~ AH/20 ~ 6.4.2 ~ Verification rule 21 ~ Typo: "one of corresponding".~
~ AH/21 ~ 7.1.3 ~ Legality rule 5 ~ We decided to remove the "Integrity" aspect if Secunet confirmed they didn't need it. Was this discussed in the meeting in Paris?~
~ AH/22 ~ 7.1.3 ~ Static semantics bullet 4 (counting manually) ~ Typo: It seems wrong to have a rule in square brackets. It suggests it isn't relly a rule.~
~ AH/23 ~ 10 ~ Opening para. ~ The opening para doesn't appear to be a complete intro to the section or a definition that is particularly relevant to just this section.~
~ AH/24 ~ 11.1 ~ Requirement ~ This high-level requirement and rationale don't justify the need to raise exceptions, in fact the rationale implies that we shouldn't!~
~ AH/25 ~ 11.2 ~ Second para of legality rules ~ The second para appears to contain a contradiction "Raise expressions are not in SPARK 2014; for a raise statement to be in SPARK 2014" unless there is a subtlety to the terms "raise expression" and "raise statement" that I'm not aware of.~
~ AH/26 ~ Appendix A ~ NA ~ This section has not been reviewed by the review team. Recommend that it is either reviewed by the authors and updated or excluded from the version that goes to the advisory panel.~
~ AH/27 ~ General ~ NA ~ I've just realised that I've read some detail on Ghost Functions but didn't see anything on Ghost Types and Ghost Variables.~
~ AH/28 ~ General ~ NA ~ [M213-043] has been discussing whether or not a global aspect must always be put in place manually whenever there is a depends aspect that references globals. The conclusion of this discussion may affect the RM.~
~ SM/1 ~ Copyright ~ 1 ~ Copyright should be Altran UK Ltd~
~ SM/2 ~ Copyright ~ 1 ~ SM to confirm use of GFDL with Romain. Probably ok.~
~ SM/3 ~ Introduction~ 3/3~ Are there really Aspects that are defined to support the interface between tested and proven units? - which ones?~
~ SM/4~ Introduction~ 3/5~ GNAT (in caps)~
~ SM/5~ 1.1~ 3/7~ Reword "... Given ... gives ... given" eg. replace last "given" by "specified"~
~ SM/6~ 1.4~ 4/bullet 1~ Typo "aspect and pragamas" -> "aspects and pragmas"~
~ SM/7~ 1.4~ 4/bullet 1~ We need a note somewhere that the pragmas are still to be added to the LRM.~
~ SM/8~ 1.5~ 5/bullet 3~ Strictly speaking, a check can't be raised, so some rewording needed here.~
~ SM/9~ 1.5~ 5/last para of 1.5~ Suggest you either define "formal program verification" (or maybe just "formal verification") as "formal verification of robustness properties and functional properties taken together" (similar to how "flow analysis" is defined).~
~ SM/10~ General~ n/a~ *Not for this draft* - ToDo: consider adding a glossary with terms such as "flow analysis" and "formal [program] verification" defined.~
~ SM/11~ 1.5.1~ 5/2~ Is talking about an Assume as an assertion strictly correct? Maybe this will become clearer  when the Proof Statements section has been added.~
~ SM/12~ 1.5.1~ 5/final para of 1.5.1~ The first sentence needs to be reworded. It could be read as saying that the tools will give a different answer depending on the platform they are run on. I know this isn't what it is supposed to say. "Note that formal verification must take account of the environment in which a program will be executed"?~
~ SM/13~ 1.6~ 5/second para of 1.6~ I'm not sure "invalid" is the right word. "unverified"?~
~ SM/14~ 1.7.1~ 6~ Suggest starting para with "Code Policies" rather than "Guidelines".~
~ SM/15~ Introduction~ ~ Is the use of square brackets used to denote something? If not, suggest use of normal brackets.~
~ SM/16~ 1.8~ 7/bullet 1~ Delete "although" and start new sentence.~
~ SM/17~ 1.8~ 8/bullet 4~ We need to loosen this statement - we are considering not re-implementing the integrity contract.~
~ SM/18~ 1.9.1~ 9/bullet 6~ "tools"->"language".~
~ SM/19~ 1.9.2~ 9/5~ Insert "at least" before "as good as".~
~ SM/20~ 1.9.3~ 10/bullet 1~ How could something as specific as being an ATM system drive a code policy - other than being by virtue of a standard? Just "Server class" is ok, or maybe "Server class information systems"?~
~ SM/21~ 1.9.5~ 11/2~ Something wrong with grammar of first sentence.~
~ SM/22~ 1.9.6~ 13/2~ Do we say what this new aspect is somewhere - or is that part of the ToDo?~
~ SM/23~ 1.10.1~ 14~ Suggest term being defined is highlighted or italicised.~
~ SM/24~ 1.11~ 15~ Why "interim"?~
~ SM/25~ 11.2~ 67~ Number missing from legaility rule 2.~
~ SM/26~ 10.1 (and elsewhere?)~ 66~ Suggest we either hide Notes in the issued draft or tidy-up the language a bit "... I don't understand ..." seems a bit informal.~
~ SM/27~ 9~ 63~ "toolset"->"language".~
~ SM/28~ A~ 75 onwards~ We should include an up-to-date mapping spec if we can do so without delaying release of the document.~
~ JEB01~ 1.2~ para 1.~ Typo: "with subsequent releases of the toolset" (not software) to be consistent with earlier text.~
~ JEB02~ 1.2~ last line.~ Mandatory : What are you trying to convey here. Clearly the content of the document may change when the document is updated. Do you actually mean that the target of particular scope of work may change?~
~ JEB03~ 1.4~ Item 1.~ Typos: expression -> expressions AND pragamas -> pragmas.~
~ JEB04~ General~ General~ Desirable: The use of hyperlink cross references that refer to names rather than section numbers makes a print-out of the document hard to navigate. Would it be possible to include the section number / page number in these cross references too?~
~ JEB05~ 1.7.2~ Final~ Typo: easier to read as "... belong in this document, in future it...." (replace "then" with ",")~
~ JEB06~1.7.4~ Final sentence~ Typo: replace "that" with "this" I think. "Where greater precision is required, this will..."~
~ JEB07~ 1.7.5~ ~ Desirable: Could we cross reference section 1.10 here? End of chapter is a bit vague especially as the final section in this chapter is Notes on the current draft.~
~ JEB08~ 1.8~ para 7.~ Typo: "but a may" should read "but may"~
~ JEB09 ~ 1.8~  page 8 para 2.~ Desirable: Phrase "are only partly within the SPARK 2014 language and other parts in another language" is difficult to read, perhaps replace "and" with "with" or replace "and other parts in another language" with "where other parts are in another language".~
~ JEB10~ 1.8~ page 8 para 2~ Mandatory: Why "|SPARK|"? is this some control sequence?~
~ JEB11~ 1.8~ page 8~ Mandatory: The statement "Support for specifying and verifying properties of secure systems shall be improved" is a very weak statement, improved as compared with what?~
~ JEB12~ 1.8~ page 8 Final bullet~ Desirable: I don't like the use of the word "significant". Do you mean "observable effect" or "discernable effect".~
~ JEB13~ 1.2~ ~ Desirable: It would be useful to make a statement as to which milestone this document corresponds to. Throughout we refer to things being deferred to Milestone A or Release B. I would like to see something that states that this is Milestone X version so that we know how soon deferred material will appear and it would enable checking that there are no references to past milestones.~
~ JEB14~ 1.9.5~ General~ Observation: Will generative analysis support abstract state? Or will it be based purely on the concrete state.~
~ JEB15~4.1.4~ Second ToDo~ Observation: As Language Defined attributes form Appendix K of the ARM I suggest that the supported Attributes should be presented in an appendix.~
~ JEB16~ Sections 2 onward~ General~ Desirable: Where language restrictions are made it would be nice if there was a trace back to the strategic requirement that causes the restriction. I think this would help motivate the restrictions.~
~ JEB17~ 5.1~ Item 1~ Desirable: Put delay_statement before abort_statement to match order in ARM.~
~ JEB0~ 6.1~ page 31 para 2~ Mandatory: Why "[SPARK]" is this a control sequence that should be expanded to SPARK 2014?~
~ JEB0~6.1.3~ page 33~ Desirable: Is the function "Exactly_One_Of" defined somewhere? Surely this expands to   (A1 and not A2 and not ... and not An) Or (not A1 and A2 and not ... and not An) Or ... Or (not A1 and not A2 and not ... and An) ~
~ JEB18~ 6.1.3~ page 34 Verification Rule 1~ Typo : "has to proven" should read "has to be proven"~
~ JEB19~ 6.1.4~ page 35 first para~ Observation : I take it that in this requirement the formal parameter referred to is a formal parameter of an enclosing subprogram, otherwise it would suggest that global lists include the formal parameters of the subprogram declaration with which they are associated.~
~ JEB20~ 6.1.4~ page 35 Semantics last requirement~ Desirable: I assume that In_Out is both and input and an output mode. Would this not be clearer to state that a global data item that is only used in a proof context must have a Proof_In mode?~
~ JEB21~ 6.1.4~ page 36 Dynamic Semantics~ Typo : "Global aspect" not just "Global" to be consistent with rest of section.~
~ JEB22~ 6.3.3~ page 42 First para in section~ Typo: "its its" should read "its". Remove duplicate word.~
~ JEB23~ 6.3.3 and 6.3.4~ General~ Comment withdrawn~
~ JEB24~6.4.2~ page 44 Verification rules 1~ Typo: "at least one of corresponding" should read "at least one of the corresponding"~
~ JEB25~ 6.4.2~ page 44 Verification rules 2 and 3~ I would prefer to see these two rules reworded in the form "In SPARK 2014, a procedure call shall not pass..." The current wording is a bit difficult to read and not as formal as other rules, also it would be helpful if each rule statement was stand alone.~
~ JEB26~ 7~ page 47 second para.~ Observation: is it possible to avoid the double negative here.~
~ JEB27~ 7.1.2~ page 48 para 2~ Desirable: the use of the word "may" here suggests that the Volatile Input can appear as an Output in global aspects is that really possible? Similarly for Volatile Output.~
~ JEB28~ 7.1.3~ page 48 item 1 Rationale~ Typo: "since modular is analysis performed" should read "since modular analysis is performed"~
~ JEB29~ 7.1~ page 50~ Typo, should the static semantics numbered items restart from 1 twice (following notes)?~
~ JEB30~ 7.1~ page 50 second item 2.~ Typo, "specification is is" should read "specification is"~
~ JEB31~ 7.1~ page 50 Verification Rules~ Typo, "Verification Rules" is capitalised here but "dynamic semantics" is not in the next para. Which is right?~
~ JEB32~ 7.1.5~ page 52 items 2 and 3~ Typo: I think you mean "initial condition specific" not "initializes-specific" in both these paras.~
~ JEB33~ 7.2.6~ page 56 para 7 (3rd requirement, 2nd bullet)~ Desirable: This would be easier to read as "Abstract(X) does not have another mode" rather than "Abstract(X) will not have another mode".~
~ JEB34~ Appendix A~ Through-out (eg page 113 code line 24, page 120 code line 13)~ Desirable: I appreciate that the appendix was not subject to review but if it is being published with the remaining LRM then I really think that the examples must match the LRM. In particular the use of "Refined_ " aspects is very patchy in the appendix. Originally this caused me to believe that the material in 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 regarding where Global and Depends aspects may appear were wrong.~
~ JEB35~ General~ ~ Observation: Much improved from last time. Note that I have not commented where I feel the subsequent "ToDo" addresses a weakness in the preceding text.~
