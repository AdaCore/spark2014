.Actions on Chapter 1 - owned by Tucker:

Reviewer: CC
Section: 1
Page/para: page 6. 1.8???
Comment: 
there is a missing discussion about what we used to call "alfa-friendly"
code. I don't think we want to reuse this concept but we need to define
precisely what are the characteristics of a non-s14 subprogram that can
call or be called by a s14 one so that the formal verif on the latter be
meaningful. We also want to minimize (eliminate?) the restrictions on
Ada code that has no influence on s14 code.
Action: Capture high-level information about how SPARK 2014 is intended to be used - probably in chapter 1. This needs to include "boundary issues" and assumptions about non-SPARK 2014 subprograms that are called from SPARK 2014. Boundaries exist between (1) spec in SPARK and body not in SPARK and (2) declarations not in SPARK cannot be used within a SPARK body. Open TN to record this discussion.

Reviewer: review meeting
Section: n/a
Page/para: n/a
Comment: Consider a mechanism (aspect?) by which developer can indicate that an entity is/is not supposed to be within SPARK 2014 (so that error messages can be generated appropriately).
Action: Already covered by TN LB15-032

Reviewer: SM et al
Section: 1
Page/para: 
Comment: Section 1.5 says something about Verification Rules, but I think we need a section of the introduction dedicated to structure and a
definition of which rules appear in each subsection (Dynamic Semantics, Static Semantics, Verification Rules, ...).
Action: Add this description - probably to section 1.9. (NB. legality rules are different to verification rules because they cannot be ignored, whereas verification rules could be)

Reviewer: QO
Section: 1
Page/para:
Comment: The use of profiles needs to be highlighted in the introduction.
Action: Add section to introduction to explain how profiles can be used in different contexts by the developers.

Reviewer: QO
Section: 1
Page/para:
Comment: Covers QO's comments 1-3
Action: consider addition of section 0/rationale which presents vision and goals in the most sales-savvy way.

Reviewer: Language lawyers
Section:
Page/para:
Comment: need a better definition of "side-effect free".
Action: Add definition to Introduction (probably in same section as boundary issues).

Reviewer: 	NW
Section:	1
Page/para:	3/1
Comment:	"SPARK 2014"   Change later? When do we need the right language and tool names throughout?
Action: Leave as-is in this issue. The name is a macro so it can easily be changed later for branding purposes.

Reviewer: 	NW
Section:	1.2
Page/para:	3/Bullet 3
Comment:	Text implies compiler tie-in. We need to be carefult to consider clients who use SPARK but this other compilers. Reword?
Action: LRM should not be GNAT-specific; references to GNAT should be removed.

Reviewer: 	NW
Section:	1.2
Page/para:	3/Bullet 4
Comment:	Not clear to me if (a) the language spec is complete, but the first tool release is not, or (b) the language spec is partial and the tool release matches is, or (c) a hybrid. This bullet implies tasking is in the language spec, but it's not in the first tool release?
Action: In section 1.4 remove word "currently" from Tasking bullet. Move comments/ToDos about rel2+ version of language to an appendix of future enhancements.

.Actions on body of document - owned by Trevor (and his delegates!):

Reviewer: several
Section: 2-14
Page/para: 
Comment: Currently we distinguish between verification rules checked by proof and those checked by flow analyis. Is this necessary in an LRM? 
Action: This distinction should be removed from the document but we should record elsewhere the ideas we have captured about what is implemented where.

Reviewer: review meeting
Section: 2-14
Page/para: 
Comment: Classification used so far not adequate. We also need to add Subset rules.
Action: Add this subsection to 2-14 and document its meaning in 1.9.

Reviewer: 	NW
Section:	Appendix C.2.1
Page/para:	99/Body of public child A in SPARK 2005
Comment:	General commnet, but thought of it here: I hope we can clear up the horror that is public/private SPARK children in 2014? Most projects of any size ban them as unworkably confusing!
Action: Covered by Todo on page 98.

Reviewer: Front-end + JEB
Section:
Page/para:
Comment: legality rules concerning param aspects & conditional dependencies are hard to understand 
Action: Keep the grammar. Keep the legality rules and resolve specific issues where they are unclear. Find some way to distinguish rules we are implementing in release 1 from those we aren't.

Reviewer: STT
Section: 6.2
Page/para:
Comment:
A (6.2 Strict Modes) STT p. 78 The terms "import" and "export" are used here.  Don't we mean "input" and "output"?
Action: standardise on input/ouput for subprograms

Reviewer: FS 
Section: 3
Page/para:
Comment: Static semantics of dynamic & predicate subtypes unclear.
Action: Explain static semantics of dynamic & predicate subtypes - FS to provide examples where clarification needed.

Reviewer: CC
Section:
Page/para:
Comment: We need verification rules for aliasing in the context of object renaming.
Action: Check the legality rule has been included.

Reviewer: RC
Section:
page/para:
Comment: check legality of renamings in global and depends apsects
Action: check and add if necessary

Reviewer: CC
Section:
Pagae/para: page 32
Comment: I have some doubts about the "=>+" notation. It doesn't seem
necessary and doesn't help particularly the reader...
this is the first instance of a particularly weird notation so far...
Action: No action.

Reviewer: STT & JEB
Section: 9
Page/para:
Comment: absence of tasking seems like a major regression/omission.
Action: RC to send RavenSPARK manual to STT. STT to consider if a simple form of tasking can by included in time for release 1.

Reviewer: FS & STT
Section:
Page/para:
Comment: is unchecked conversion inlcuded in S2014?
Action: It should be. Check and include.

Reviewer: YM
Section: 5,6,7
Page/para:
Comment: LRM is not yet stable enough to start implementation - in particular the wording of legality rules still has inconsistencies (see YM's comments for detail)
Action: TJ: Focus on parcticular sections/aspects in turn and resolve each one before moving on. keep working in the LRM doc but use TNs to ask for comments. Abstract_State is the first priority. 
Action: SM/RC to task JB & PE in parallel to start developing test cases.
Action: CC & SM to consider template for traceabiility of test cases back to LRM (and other "operational requirements")
