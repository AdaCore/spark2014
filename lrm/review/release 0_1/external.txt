Section: 1.5
Page/para: 5
Comment: There is no description of what is captured under the subheading "Checked by Proof" although this appears in the body of the document.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 1.6
Page/para: page 6
Comment: The list of reasons for using restrictions might be easier to read if presented as a list. 
The penultimate and final items have connectives but these are different ("and" and "or" respectively).
It might read better if the "and" is removed.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 1.8
Page/para: List item 1.
Comment: "that is not in SPARK 2014" suggest removing the word "in".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 3
Page/para: page 11, para 1 
Comment: "does not add any declaration or type to Ada 2012" would read better using plural for "declarations" and "types".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 4.1
Page/para: page 13
Comment: This section does not indicate whether the contents of LRM sections 4.1.5 User-Defined References (generalised_reference)
or section 4.1.6 User-defined indexing (generalised_indexing) are included in SPARK 2014. Suggest including sections with these numbers to explicitly exclude or include these features.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: Generally
Page/para: 
Comment: Where the SPARK Syntax differs from Ada2012 it might be clearer to present the SPARK 2014 Syntax explicitly 
(what would be great would be to show it as a red-line of the Ada2012 Syntax so that removed items are struck through).
This would often be easier to interpret than the textual description of the restriction (although any motivation for the restriction would be of benefit.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 4.3.4
Page/para: 
Comment: This section is poorly structured - it appears to be a SPARK2014 extention but there is no Syntax subheading and the text would be easier to read if broken down into 
Legality rules, Semantics etc. 


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 4.3.4
Page/para: Page 15, last sentance
Comment: Use "different from" rather than "different than", the latter is only accepted in American English.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 4.4
Page/para: 
Comment: How is "side-effect free" formally defined.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 5.1
Page/para: Item 2 
Comment: "shall not be am" should read "an" not "am".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 5.5
Page/para: 
Comment: The loop syntax is restricted by the elimination of iterator_specification this is not clear at the point where the Ada Syntax is presented. 
Might be helpful to present the restriction to the syntax here rather than eliminating the subsection that describes iterator_specification. (5.5.2).


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 5.5.3
Page/para: page 20
Comment:In the Note "The following rules are not included on the" should read "included in the".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.2
Page/para: Item 1 Legality Rules
Comment: For consistency capitalise "aspect" in "Param aspect" or remove capitalisation of "aspect" in "Global Aspect and Dependency Aspect".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.3
Page/para: First Para
Comment: "specify a mutually independent cases" should be "specify mutually independent cases".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.3
Page/para: Verification Rules item 1.
Comment: "con formant" should be "conformant".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.3
Page/para: Dynamic Semantics item 1.
Comment: should "aspect_specification" be in the program font?


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 27, Static Semantics item 5, final bullet
Comment: The final definition of independence seems incomplete - does this mean that Y and Y(J) are independent or 
Y(I) and Y(I) are independent and that Y(I) and Y(J) are independent when indexes I and J evaluate to the same value.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 27, Static Semantics item 6, bullet 2 
Comment: Typo "efective" also does the * signify anythingin mode "out*".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 27, Static semantics item 6, subitem 1.
Comment: The mode selector values of "In" and "Out" do not match the options in the Syntax (these should be "Input"or "Output".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 28, item 5
Comment: "all of the conditions of the if_expression evaluates" final word should be "evaluate"


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 28, item 6
Comment: "evalustaes" should be "evaluates"


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.5
Page/para: page 28
Comment: "or a abstract_state name" should read "an" not "a".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.5
Page/para: page 29
Comment: "a object" should be "an object" twice.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.5
Page/para: page 29, para 5(a)
Comment: You need to be careful about modes and effective modes. Here I think you are refering to effective modes but then Proof is only a mode_Selector value not an effective mode.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.5
Page/para: page 30, final example
Comment: What about the "Proof" mode selector, the comment states that all types of global_specification are covered.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.6
Page/para: Legality Rules
Comment: Should a mode_selector of "Proof" be prohibited here.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.6
Page/para: Examples
Comment: In the comments "the values remainder of" should read "the values of the remainder of" - three occurances.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: page 33, Legality Rules
Comment: You need to be careful with the wording here. From the Syntax import_lists only  occur within a conditional_dependency but I expect the 
constraints apply more widely to any imports in any dependency_list.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: Legality Rules item 8
Comment: This needs rephrasing, I don't know what "shall appear at least of a dependency_relation" is supposed to mean. 
Also second sentence is incomplete.

Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: page 33 Static Semantics item 8
Comment: Typo "export-list" should be "export_list".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: Page 34, Static Semantics item 10
Comment: Typo "A an export_list" should read "An export_list".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: page 34/35
Comment: In example procedure S, The Global Z does not appear as an import in the dependency relationship - surely that is an error.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.3.3
Page/para: Checked By Proof, item 2
Comment: Final sentence "then all the rule applies" should read "then the rule applies".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.3.4
Page/para: First para
Comment: Typo "If subprogram" should read "If a subprogram" or "If the subprogram".


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.4.2
Page/para: page 38 first para of section
Comment: "when one of names" should be "when one of the names" in final sentence.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 6.4.3
Page/para: page 40, Item 1 bullet 3
Comment: "does not does not" should read "does not" similarly "the the" should read "the".

Comment: "of a an abstract" should read "of an abstract"


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 7.2.2
Page/para: Verification Rules, item 1
Comment: It is not clear to me what check is being performed here.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 7.2.2
Page/para: Legality Rules
Comment: it seems to me that according to these rules ther refined state aspect can have  state with just the Input simple_property. 
This is not consistent with the abstract state aspect, which also requires volatile.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 7.2.4
Page/para: page 55 first para in section.
Comment: "will declared" should read "will be declared"

Comment: How can this clause hold in general, is it not made redundant by the next clause.


Reviewer: JEB
Section: 14.1.2
Page/para: Todo
Comment: It would be very useful to list the packages supported by SPARK 2014. 



Reviewer: JEB
Section: Appendix A
Page/para: General 
Comment: Some of the features of Ada which are now permitted were restricted from SPARK95 because the code was potentially harder to read - 
ie. a reviewer or coder might misinterpret even though the compiler will always interpret the code unambiguously. One such example is default 
subprogram parameters. I would like to be clear whether the restrictions listed are mandetory for the code to be considered SPARK 2014.
I think it will be important to provide off-the-shelf profiles that use an appropriate set of restrictions for various contexts. It would probably
be useful to claim that certain profiles will make the code easier to review - would be good for a safety argument. 


Reviewer: JEB
Section: Appendix A
Page/para: 7.1.2 (1)
Comment: "absence of a abstract_state_name" should read "an" in place of "a"


Reviewer: JEB

Comment: "Enforces the rule the" second "the" should read "that".

Reviewer: JEB
Section: Appendix B
Page/para: General
Comment: Not sure what the purpose of this section is. There are Extended Legality Rules through the document. 
This is not a summary of all the extended legality rules - if that is intended then there are several missing.

Comment: To be a pure translation from SPARK2005 to SPARK2014 should you not use --# derives S from *,X; 
to match the use of =>+ in the Dependancy aspect.
(another instance on page 96)

Reviewer: JEB

Comment: Why do you write "Specifications in SPARK" but "Body in SPARK". 
I would have thought that the "Specifications" should be singular.

Reviewer: JEB

Comment: The choice of Outputs as the state name (similarly Input) in this section makes the annotations really hard to read in SPARK 2014.

Reviewer: JEB
Section: C.2 
Page/para: Page 124 
Comment: In SPARK 2014 if a function is declared and defined just for use within a proof context how do we demonstrate coverage in a system where 
there are high code coverage requirements - especially if the final system is being executed with dynamic proof checks switched off. 

Reviewer: JEB
Section: C.2 
Page/para: Page 127 
Comment: Are the double set of brackets necessary in the second code fragment (line 2).


Reviewer: JEB
Section: C.4.6
Page/para: Page 137 
Comment: It is a shame that RavenSPARK is not to be supported initially - do we have a time frame for it's introduction. 
This is probably important to legacy customers and future users.
