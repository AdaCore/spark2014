Tasks and Synchronization
=========================

Concurrent programs require the use of different specification and verification
techniques from sequential programs. For this reason, tasks and
synchronization features are currently excluded from |SPARK|.

.. todo:: RCC: The above text implies that |SPARK| does not support Ada.Calendar,
   which is specified in RM 9.6. SPARK 2005 supports and prefers Ada.Real_Time
   and models the passage of time as an external "in" mode protected own variable.
   Should we use the same approach in |SPARK|? Discussion under TN [LB07-024]. Target: D2.

.. todo:: Add Tasking. Target: rel2
