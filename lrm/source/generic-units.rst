Generic Units
=============

Generic units are not classified as being |SPARK| or non-|SPARK|. Only their
instantiations are.

In |SPARK| a generic unit is not allowed to have a child unit.

.. todo::  Constructive modular analysis of generics.  Will require
     significant restrictions and extra aspects to implement.
