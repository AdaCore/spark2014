The Standard Libraries
======================

This chapter will describe how |SPARK| treats the Ada predefined
language environment and standard libraries, corresponding
to appendices A through H of the Ada RM. The goal is that |SPARK| programs are able
to use as much as possible of the  the Ada predefined language environment and standard libraries.

In particular, it is intended that predefined container generics
suitable for use in |SPARK| will be provided. These will
have specifications as similar as possible to those of
Ada's bounded containers (i.e., Ada.Containers.Bounded_*), but with
constructs removed or modified as needed in order to maintain the
language invariants that |SPARK| relies upon in providing
formal program verification.

*To be completed in the Milestone 4 version of this document.*
