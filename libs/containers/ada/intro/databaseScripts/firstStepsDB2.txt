Required steps: 
Set up a DB2 instance to work with DB2. 

Optional steps: 
To validate your installation files, instance, and database functionality, run the Validation Tool, /opt/ibm/db2/V10.1/bin/db2val. For more information, see "db2val" i
n the DB2 Information Center. 

Refer to "What's new" http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/topic/com.ibm.db2.luw.wn.doc/doc/c0052035.html in the DB2 Information Center to learn about
 the new functions for DB2 V10.1. 

Open First Steps by running "db2fs" using a valid user ID such as the DB2 instance owner's ID. You will need to have DISPLAY set and a supported web browser in the pat
h of this user ID. 

Verify that you have access to the DB2 Information Center based on the choices you made during this installation. If you performed a typical or a compact installation,
 verify that you can access the IBM Web site using the internet. If you performed a custom installation, verify that you can access the DB2 Information Center location
 specified during the installation. 

Ensure that you have the correct license entitlements for DB2 products and features installed on this machine. Each DB2 product or feature comes with a license certifi
cate file (also referred to as a license key) that is distributed on an Activation CD, which also includes instructions for applying the license file. If you purchased
 a base DB2 product, as well as, separately priced features, you might need to install more than one license certificate. The Activation CD for your product or feature
 can be downloaded from Passport Advantage if it is not part of the physical media pack you received from IBM. For more information about licensing, search the Informa
tion Center (http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v10r1/index.jsp) using terms such as "license compliance", "licensing" or "db2licm".
