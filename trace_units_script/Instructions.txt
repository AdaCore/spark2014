1) The script takes a list of files and/or directories as arguments
   and recursively looks for files that end in ".rst", ".ads", ".adb"
   and ".ada".  If no arguments are presented, then the script
   assumes that the argument is the current path ('.'). Then it
   checks the trace units in the ".rst" files against trace units in
   the other files (".ads", ".adb", ".ada").

   If you are running the script from within the SPARK2014 repository,
   then give ".." as a parameter.

2) Duplicate files are not taken into consideration.

3) The script does not get affected by wrong spaces.

4) Trace Units in tests must be followed either by a blank line, by
   code or by another trace unit (must not have an irrelevant comment
   directly after a TU, because it will make the script think that
   the comment is part of the TU).

   Example of a TU in a test:

    --  TU: 9. Each ``mode_selector`` shall occur at most once in a single
    --  Global aspect.

5) After the script gets executed, a csv file is created that says
   which TU was found where. This allows us to find which test covers
   which TU. I use LibreOffice to read this file (set the
   separator to comma ',' and the delimiter to double-quote '"').

6) If you want to add a TU in the LRM for which you do not
   want to have a corresponding test, then add either:

    "-cbatu-"     (stands for Checked By Another Trace Unit)

                            or

    "-nt-"        (not tested/testable)
