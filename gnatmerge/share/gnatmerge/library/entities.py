    This class allows to merge results of entities of a lower level
    (e.g. children) to produce results for entities of a higher
    level. Typically, to merge proof results on the subprogram level to the
    package level, one should do:

        m = Merge()
        pck = m.new_entity("PACKAGE")
        subp = pck.new_input("SUBPROGRAM", maps={"OK" : "PROVED"})

    the OK status at subprogram level.
