   --  Timing relies on Ada.Calendar and not Ada.Execution_Time, because the
   --  latter would force the use of Ada.Real_Time and in turn the GNAT tasking
   --  runtime, which incurs performance penalty at each allocation and
   --  deallocation (and we have plenty of those). Here we only care about
   --  estimate timing, so the less-precise and potentially non-monotonic clock
   --  from Ada.Calendar is acceptable.
