package Named_Semaphores is

   --  (Quite) Thin Ada binding for named semaphores, that works on Linux and
   --  Windows. See also sem_overview(7) and the documentation of Semaphore
   --  Objects of Windows.

   --  The objective is to limit the access to some resource to at most N
   --  clients (e.g. processes). To this end, the user can create a semaphore
   --  with a fixed name using Create and the initial value N. This semaphore
   --  can then be opened additionally in other processes using the same fixed
   --  name.

   --  Whenever the processes want to access the resource, they call Wait. If
   --  the current value of the semaphore is greater than 0, Wait decrements
   --  this value and returns. After finishing with the resource, the processes
   --  call Release, which increments the value of the semaphore again.

   --  If upon calling Wait, the semaphore value is 0, the process waits (=
   --  Wait does not return) until it becomes non-zero. If several processes
   --  are waiting, only one will continue, chosen randomly.

   --  There is one difference between Linux and Windows for this
   --  implementation. On Linux, a named semaphore must be explicitly deleted
   --  using Delete. (However, the semaphore stays active until all processes
   --  have closed it). On Windows, the semaphore is destroyed automatically
   --  when all processes have closed it and a manual delete operation is not
   --  provided. If you want to achieve the same behavior on both systems, make
   --  sure that at least one process keeps the semaphore opened for as long as
   --  you need it, and call Delete at the end.

   type Semaphore is limited private;

   procedure Create (Name : String; Init : Natural; S : out Semaphore);
   --  Creates a semaphore with the given name and the initial value Init
   --  in the semaphore namespace. The semaphore can be used directly in the
   --  same process using Wait, Release or Close, or it can be opened via Open
   --  in other processes.

   procedure Open (Name : String; S : out Semaphore);
   --  Open a semaphore that already has been created previously using Create

   procedure Close (S : in out Semaphore);
   --  Closes the handle on the semaphore

   procedure Wait (S : in out Semaphore);
   --  Block until the value of the semaphore is larger than 0, then decrease
   --  the value of the semaphore by 1 and return.

   procedure Release (S : in out Semaphore);
   --  Increase the value of the semaphore by 1

   procedure Delete (Name : String);
   --  Deletes the name of the semaphore from the semaphore namespace. The
   --  semaphore remains alive until all processes have closed it. This
   --  procedure is a no-op on Windows.
