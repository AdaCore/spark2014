   -- Component Info Maps --
   -------------------------

   --  For the implementation details: This is one place where we look
   --  at the declaration node to find which discriminant values imply the
   --  presence of which components. We traverse the N_Component_List of the
   --  type declaration, and for each component, and for each N_Variant_Part,
   --  we store a record of type [Component_Info] which contains the N_Variant
   --  node to which the component/variant part belongs, and the N_Variant_Part
   --  to which this N_Variant node belongs. In this way, we can easily access
   --  the discriminant (the Name of the N_Variant_Part) and the discrete
   --  choice (the Discrete_Choices of the N_Variant) of that component or
   --  variant part.

   --  The map [Comp_Info] maps the component entities and N_Variant_Part nodes
   --  to their information record. This map is populated during marking.

   --  We ignore "completely hidden" components of derived record types (see
   --  also the discussion in einfo.ads and sem_ch3.adb)
