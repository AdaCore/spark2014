package Gnat2Why.Subprograms is

   --  This package deals with the translation of GNAT functions and
   --  statements to Why declarations.

   --  Subprograms are translated to Why programs with pre- and postconditions
   --  (contracts). These assertions have to be self-guarded to enforce the
   --  same semantics as if these assertions were executed. For example, an
   --  array access like
   --     X (I) = 0
   --  must be protected by a condition:
   --     I in X'First .. X'Last and then X (I) = 0.
   --  This is checked by generating, for all assertions, equivalent programs
   --  that must be runtime error free.
   --
   --  Subprogram contracts may contain calls to expression functions. As we
   --  have translated these functions to Why logic functions, nothing special
   --  needs to be done.
   --
   --  For a Subprogram *declaration*, we generate a Why parameter
   --  declaration, with the full argument list and the translation of the
   --  contract, if any.
   --
   --  For a Subprogram *body*, we generate a Why program function *without*
   --  parameters (expect a unit parameter); all Ada parameters and local
   --  variables of subprograms, as well as local subprograms, are put at the
   --  global toplevel in Why.
   --
   --  More specific documentation is given at the beginning of each function
   --  in this package.
