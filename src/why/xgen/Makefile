# The Why-tree Ada files are automatically generated. This Makefile is used to
# build and generate those files. The main file for generation is xtree.adb. In
# practice, the files that are suffixed by a *-tmpl contain specific keywords
# of the form _@Stuff@_ that are replaced by xtree.
# In particular, to modify the dependencies of one of those files, it is
# necessary to update the -tmpl. To modify a specific node, xtree_sinfo.adb
# should be modified.
