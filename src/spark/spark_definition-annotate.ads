package SPARK_Definition.Annotate is

   --  This package deals with justification of individual messages using
   --  pragma Annotate.

   --  The user can suppress check messages emitted by GNATprove by putting a
   --  pragma Annotate in the source code. An example is the following:

   --    return (X + Y) / (X - Y);
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, False_Positive,
   --                     "divide by zero", "reviewed by John Smith");

   --  The pragma has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Category, Pattern, Reason);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove   is a fixed identifier
   --    Category    is one of False_Positive or Intentional
   --    Pattern     is a string literal describing the pattern of the messages
   --                which shall be suppressed
   --    Reason      is a string literal providing a reason for the
   --                suppression.

   --  All arguments should be provided.

   --  The category has no impact on the behavior of the tool, but the idea
   --  is that False_Positive should be used to suppress checks that cannot
   --  occcur, but GNATprove was unable to detect this; Intentional indicates
   --  that the condition can occure but is not considered to be a bug.

   --  Pattern should be a substring of the GNATprove check message to be
   --  suppressed.

   --  Reason is any string that the user can use to provide a reason for the
   --  suppression. This reason may be present in a GNATprove report.

   --  Placement rules are as follows: in a statement list or declaration list,
   --  pragma Annotate applies to the preceding item in the list, ignoring
   --  other pragma Annotate. If there is no preceding item, the pragma applies
   --  to the enclosing entity. If the preceding item is a subprogram body, the
   --  pragma applies both to the body and the spec of the subprogram.

   --  This package also stores additional uses of pragma Annotate.

   --  A pragma Annotate for Iterable_For_Proof has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Iterable_For_Proof, Kind, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove            is a fixed identifier
   --    Iterable_For_Proof   is a fixed identifier
   --    Kind                 must be one of "Model" or "Contains"
   --    E                    is a function entity

   --  If Kind is "Model" then E must have the following signature:
   --    function Get_Model (C : Container_Type) return Model_Type;

   --  where Container_Type and Model_Type both have an Iterable aspect that
   --  allows for ... of quantification on compatible element types.

   --  When such an annotation is provided, for ... of quantification on a
   --  container C is translated as for ... of quantification on its model
   --  Get_Model (C) instead.

   --  If Kind is "Contains" then E must have the following signature:
   --    function Contains (C : Container_Type; X : Element) return Boolean;

   --  where Container_Type have an Iterable aspect that allows for ... of
   --  quantification on elements of type Element.

   --  When such an annotation is provided, for ... of quantification on a
   --  container C is translated in Why3 as quantification over elements
   --  using the provided Contains function.

   --  A pragma Annotate for Inline_For_Proof has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Inline_For_Proof, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Inline_For_Proof    is a fixed identifier
   --    E                   is a function entity

   --  and E must either be an expression function or have the following
   --  signature:
   --    function E (...) return ... with
   --      Post => E'Result = Expr;

   --  where Expr must not contain any forward reference to entities defined
   --  after E.

   --  When such an annotation is provided, E is translated as a function
   --  definition in Why3 on which the label "inline" is set so that gnatwhy3
   --  inlines its definition for provers.

   --  A pragma Annotate for logical equality has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Logical_Equal, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Logical_Equal       is a fixed identifier
   --    E                   is a function with the signature of an equality
   --                        function and no visible body.

   --  When such an annotation is provided for a function E, is is assumed to
   --  be an application of the logical "=" operator of Why3.

   --  A pragma Annotate for ownership can be applied either on a type, a
   --  constant, or a function. On a type, it has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate
   --        (GNATprove, Ownership, ["Needs_Reclamation",] Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Ownership           is a fixed identifier
   --    Needs_Reclamation   is a fixed string
   --    E                   is a type entity

   --  and E shall be a private type (tagged or not, but not a private
   --  extension) whose full view is in a part annotated with
   --  SPARK_Mode => Off.

   --  When such an annotation is provided for a type E, it is treated by the
   --  SPARK tool as if it contained a subcomponent of an access-to-variable
   --  type. If Needs_Reclamation is supplied, a check will be emitted to make
   --  sure that no values are left unreclaimed.
   --
   --  On a function, it has one of the following forms:
   --    pragma Annotate
   --        (GNATprove, Ownership, "Is_Reclaimed", Entity => E);
   --    pragma Annotate
   --        (GNATprove, Ownership, "Needs_Reclamation", Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Ownership           is a fixed identifier
   --    Is_Reclaimed        is a string
   --    Needs_Reclamation   is a string
   --    E                   is a function entity

   --  and E shall have a single parameter of a type annotated with ownership
   --  that needs reclamation and shall return a boolean.
   --
   --  On a constant, it has the following forms:
   --    pragma Annotate
   --        (GNATprove, Ownership, "Reclaimed_Value", Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Ownership           is a fixed identifier
   --    Reclaimed_Value     is a string
   --    E                   is a constanr entity

   --  and E shall be a constant of a type annotated with ownership that needs
   --  reclamation.

   --  When such an annotation is provided for a function E, this function is
   --  used when checking reclamation of objects of E's formal parameter type.
   --  For a given type, there shall not be more than one such function
   --  provided. If there is none, the reclamation checks will be unprovable.

   --  A pragma Annotate for automatic instantiation of lemmas has the
   --  following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Automatic_Instantiation, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove               is a fixed identifier
   --    Automatic_Instantiation is a fixed identifier
   --    E                       is a ghost procedure with no Globals nor
   --                            mutable parameters.

   --  The ghost procedure E shall be located directly after a function
   --  declaration, possibly separated by some pragmas and other ghost
   --  procedures with automatic instantiation. The procedure will be
   --  transformed into an axiom which will be included whenever the function
   --  is called.

   --  A pragma Annotate for specialized handling of static access-to-function
   --  parameters has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Higher_Order_Specialization, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove                   is a fixed identifier
   --    Higher_Order_Specialization is a fixed identifier
   --    E                           is a function or lemma procedure with
   --                                parameters of an anonymous
   --                                access-to-function type.

   --  The subprogram E shall not be volatile, dispatching, nor a borrowing
   --  traversal function. If it is a procedure, it shall be a lemma function -
   --  ghost and no outputs. Its parameters shall only occur in contracts in
   --  dereferences and as actuals in calls to functions annotated with
   --  Higher_Order_Specialization (the actual pointer value shall not be
   --  used).

   --  A pragma Annotate for container aggregates has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Container_Aggegates, Id, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Container_Aggegates is a fixed identifier
   --    Id                  is a string and can have several values to
   --                        annotate different kinds of container types and
   --                        functions.
   --    E                   is either a type with an Aggregate aspect or
   --                        a function declared in the immediate scope of
   --                        such a type.

   --  See the Aggregate_Annotation type for additional information of the
   --  different kinds of container types and their associated functions.

   --  A pragma Annotate for a handler has the following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Handler, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove           is a fixed identifier
   --    Handler             is a fixed identifier
   --    E                   is an access-to-subprogram type.

   --  The access-to-subprogram type E shall be library level and shall not
   --  have a precondition nor a postcondition.

   --  A pragma Annotate to hide or disclose information has one of the
   --  following forms:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Hide_Info,   "Info_Kind", Entity => E);
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Unhide_Info, "Info_Kind", Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove                 is a fixed identifier
   --    Hide_Info and Unhide_Info are fixed identifiers
   --    Info_Kind                 is a string that can only be
   --                              Expression_Function_Body for now.
   --    E                         is the entity whose information should be
   --                              hidden or disclosed.

   --  The location of this pragma gives the verification context on which
   --  information should be hidden or disclosed. It can only occur at the
   --  beginning of a package, subprogram, or entry body or right after a
   --  package, subprogram, or entry body or specification. The information is
   --  then hidden or disclosed (if it is hidden by default) for the
   --  verification of the package, subprogram, or entry.

   --  A pragma Annotate for private types with mutable IN parameters has the
   --  following form:
   --    pragma Annotate (GNATprove, Mutable_IN_Parameters, Entity => E);

   --  where
   --    GNATprove               is a fixed identifier
   --    Mutable_IN_Parameters   is a fixed identifier
   --    E                       is a private type.

   --  The private type E shall be either a simple private type or ultimately
   --  an access-to-variable type. It should be located directly after an
   --  entry or a subprogram with side effects.
