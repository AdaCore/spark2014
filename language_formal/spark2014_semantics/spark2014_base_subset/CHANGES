* Fixed typos:
eample: Vundef has been replaced by Undefined, but some Vundef were
forgotten in the process.

* Split some files.
For example we separate typing related definitions and proofs from
environment definitions. This allows for more flexibility when
modifying early defintions (no need to reprove everything before
testing)
