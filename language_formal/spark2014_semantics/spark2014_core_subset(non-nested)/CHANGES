Syntax extensions

   * Add unary operators +/- based on original “not” operator
   * Add array/record type declarations
   * add Indexed component and selected component to expression
   * add null statement (so it can used in if-statement if its else branch is empty)
   * extend if-then statement to if-then-else statement
   * add procedure call
   * in declaration, remove “D_Sequence”, because, in procedure we should allow empty declarations


Other changes

   * values.v
      * add error_type to run time error state

   * consider named array / record aggregate
       
     Because positional array aggregate should have at least two elements, otherwise it 
     cannot distinguish whether it’s an array aggregate or a just a single value;
	 So named array aggregate is used in our formalization, 
	 (1) which allows one element aggregate; 
	 (2) if it’s a named array aggregate, when do array_select, we don’t need 
	     to compute the offset;


Restrictions

   * now consider only non-nested array / record
      * array lower and upper bound to be type of Z instead of expression
