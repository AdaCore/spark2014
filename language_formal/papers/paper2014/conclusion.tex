%\subsection{}
%Third, formal proofs of analyzers and certified compilers.
Finally, one of our long-term goals is to provide infrastructure that can be
leveraged in a variety of ways to support machine-verified proofs of
correctness of SPARK 2014 static analysis and
translations. To this end, we will build a translation framework
from SPARK 2014 to Coq, which puts in place crucial infrastructure
necessary for supporting formal proofs of SPARK analysis. Together
with the formal semantics of SPARK, it provides the potential to
connect to the Compcert \cite{Leroy:09} certified compiler framework.
