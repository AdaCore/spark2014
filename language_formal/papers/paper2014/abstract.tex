SPARK 2014 is a subset of the Ada 2012 programming language amenable to formal
verification, supported by the GNAT compilation toolchain. It is possible to
use both industrial and academic tools that analyze SPARK 2014 programs to
guarantee that a program does not raise run-time errors and respects its
specification, mostly expressed as subprogram contracts. These analyses at
source code level are valid for the final executable only if it can be shown
that tools used for both compilation and verification comply with a common
deterministic programming language semantics.

In this paper, we present our work towards a formal semantics for SPARK 2014
that is suitable for checking that both the compiler and analyzers correctly
interpret critical parts of the program semantics. In particular, we are
interested in checking that the compiler and analyzers agree on a correct
placement of language defined checks, in order for a proved program to execute
without run-time errors.

To reach this goal, we share a common program representation between the
compiler and analyzers, that we translate into the Coq proof assistant.  We
have formalized in Coq the dynamic semantics for a core subset of SPARK 2014,
including the modeling of run-time checks, which is used to mechanically prove
that checks are correctly placed in the intermediate representation. We have
also proved the correctness of optimizations that eliminate some checks.
