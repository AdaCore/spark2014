              flow problem can be reduced to solving a safety
              problem via a simple program transformation.
              Barthe, D’Argenio, and Rezk coined the term
              “self-composition” to describe this reduction.
              This paper generalizes the self-compositional
              approach with a form of information downgrading
              recently proposed by Li and Zdancewic. We also
              identify a problem with applying the
              self-compositional approach in practice, and we
              present a solution to this problem that makes use
              of more traditional type-based approaches. The
              result is a framework that combines the best of
              both worlds, i.e., better than traditional
              type-based approaches and better than the
              selfcompositional approach.},

                  potentially powerful tool for automatic runtime
                  detection of software faults during debugging,
                  testing and maintenance. However, they have seen
                  little widespread use in practice because previous
                  assertion processing tools did not integrate easily
                  with existing programming environments, and it is
                  not well understood what kinds of assertions are
                  most effective at detecting software faults. The
                  author describes experience using an assertion
                  processing tool that was built to address the
                  concerns of ease-of-use and effectiveness. The tool
                  is called APP, an Annotation Pre-Processor for C
                  programs developed in UNIX-based development
                  environments. APP has been used to develop a number
                  of software systems over three years. Based on this
                  experience, the author presents a classification of
                  the assertions that were most effective at detecting
                  faults. While the assertions that are described
                  guard against many common kinds of faults and
                  errors, the very commonness of such faults
                  demonstrates the need for an explicit, high-level,
                  automatically checkable specification of required
                  behavior.",
