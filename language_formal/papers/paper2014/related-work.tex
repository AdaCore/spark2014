Formal semantics were previously defined for SPARK Ada 83 in \cite{Marsh:Book94,Neil:Book94}. 
This definition includes both the static and the dynamic semantics of 
the language and rely on a precise notation inspired by the Z notation. 
Formalizing the full SPARK subset was clearly a challenging task and 
the result is indeed quite impressive: more than 500 pages were 
required for the complete set of rules. However, these semantics 
were not executable (it was only given on paper) and no tool was used 
to check the soundness of the definition. Moreover, no property was 
proved using these semantics, and more importantly, run-time checks 
were only considered as side conditions on semantics rules without 
being formally described.
