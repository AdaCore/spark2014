volatile_example_a.adb:13:04: high: object with constraints on bit representation is unsuitable for aliasing via address clause
   13 |   W : Pair
      |   ^~~~~~~~
  possible explanation: type Pair doesn't have an Object_Size representation clause or aspect

      |                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  e.g. when Tmp = (X => 1, Y => 0)
