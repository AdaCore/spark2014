   10 |         R := R + In2;
      |              ~~^~~~~
  e.g. when In2 = -1
        and R = Integer'First
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer

counterex.adb:11:25: medium: assertion might fail, cannot prove R < 42
   11 |         pragma Assert (R < 42);
      |                        ^~~~~~
  e.g. when R = 43
