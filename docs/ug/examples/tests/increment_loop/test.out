    4 |  Post => X = X'Old + N
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  e.g. when N = 1
        and X = 2
        and X'Old = 0
  possible fix: loop at line 7 should mention X in a loop invariant
    7 |   for I in 1 .. N loop

increment_loop.adb:8:14: medium: overflow check might fail
    8 |      X := X + 1;
      |           ~~^~~
  e.g. when X = Integer'Last
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
  possible fix: loop at line 7 should mention X in a loop invariant
