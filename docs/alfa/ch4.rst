Expressions
-----------

In Alfa, an expression is pure, that is, its evaluation cannot modify the value
of a variable or memory location. It is equivalent to say that it only involves
calls to Alfa functions, which are pure by definition.

Operators and Expression Evaluation
-----------------------------------

In Alfa, there can be no sequence of operators of the same precedence level. 
Parentheses must be used to impose specific associations.

Type Conversions
