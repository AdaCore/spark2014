Exceptions
==========

Exceptions being raised and handled define alternate flows of control through a
program, which complicate both specification and verification of a program's
behavior. This is the reason why explicit uses of exceptions are excluded from
Alfa.

Exceptions can still be raised implicitly (for example, by the failure of a
language-defined check). Pragmas ``Assert``, ``Assertion_Policy``, ``Suppress``
and ``Unsuppress`` are in Alfa.
