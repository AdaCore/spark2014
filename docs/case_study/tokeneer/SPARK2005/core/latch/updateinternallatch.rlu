--  Rule 1
--
--  Justification:
--    C1 and (1)1 are equivalent:
--      latch__islocked(S2) and islocked(fld_currentlatch(S2)) are the
--      external and internal views of the same function.
--    C2 and (1)2 are equivalent:
--      The proof function prf_latchTimeout(State) models the value of
--      the LatchTimeout component of the refinement of State; the
--      equivalence is completed by (2)
--
--    It follows that C and (1) are equivalent expressions.
