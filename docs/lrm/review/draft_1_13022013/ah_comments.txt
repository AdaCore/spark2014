Ident: AH/1
Section: General
Page/para: General
Comment: I thought we were going to move to references that included
section numbers to allow people to read printed copies? NB I don't mind personally but if another senior reviewer has previously suggested it we should try to do it or have a good reason for note doing it.

Ident: AH/2
Section: 1.4
Page/para: pg4 oara 2
Comment: Typo: delete "section" in "which section is specific to ..."

Ident: AH/3
Section: 1.5
Page/para: last para
Comment: This para restricts the operation of the tools by mandating an ordering but I don't think this is necessary. However, it is probably worth stating things like: flow analysis is not valid and may not be possible if the legality rules are not met.


Ident: AH/4
Section: 1.9.5
Page/para: Para 2, first sentence
Comment: Poor grammar in first sentence.

Ident: AH/5
Section: 1.9.6
Page/para: Second bullet of the list starting "The way in which these are used are:"
Comment: Unclear first sentence.

Ident: AH/6
Section: 1.9.6
Page/para: First Todo
Comment: The first Todo appears to contain a heading, making it look like the Todo is empty.

Ident: AH/7
Section: 1.10.1
Page/para: Definition of inputs/outputs
Comment: Does this definition include globals of the subprogram? I suspect it does but as you explicitly state formal parameters are included but don't explicitly state globals then it becomes less clear.

Ident: AH/8
Section: 1.10.3
Page/para: Bullet 3
Comment: I thought we were planning on analysing fields in records independently. This requirement may therefore be relaxed. This needs discussion before making any changes.

Ident: AH/9
Section: 1.10.4
Page/para: Bullet 1
Comment: Is the consequence of this that users would always have to add "global => null" whenever an operation does not use globals? This feels like a bit of an overhead.


Ident: AH/10
Section: 3.9
Page/para: Todo
Comment: The Todo contradicts the text in this section. One or the other should be removed.


Ident: AH/11
Section: 5.5.3
Page/para: Syntax section
Comment: Is this Syntax section supposed to be complete? The Todo suggests it isn't. If it is supposed to be complete then "discrete_expression" needs to be defined.

Ident: AH/12
Section: 6.1
Page/para: 2nd para
Comment: [SPARK] should be replaced in the reST source with |SPARK|.


Ident: AH/13
Section: 6.1.2
Page/para: NA
Comment: Please consider including forward references to the sections that define Global, Depends and Contract_Cases

Ident: AH/14
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: Static Semantics
Comment: "A global_item is referenced if: It is an input or an output of the subprogram" needs to be extended to cover globals in subprograms called directly or indirectly.

Ident: AH/15
Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: Verification rules
Comment: Typo: "is a analyzed" => "is analyzed"

Ident: AH/16
Section: 6.1.5
Page/para: Language definition para 2
Comment: Shouldn't we state in here "on at least one path"?

Ident: AH/17
Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: 2nd Para
Comment: Two typos corrected in this version: "If **a** call is made, directly or indirectly, to this function other than in a**n** assertion expression which is not a subtype
predicate, or if the assertion policy Ignore is not selected, an error will be reported when an attempt is made to build
and execute the program."


Ident: AH/18
Section: 6.3.3
Page/para: Firsts para
Comment: Typo: "its its".


Ident: AH/19
Section: 6.3.3
Page/para: General
Comment: I expected some mention of state refinement here. Please provide a forward reference to the relevant subsection of section 7. Nb this comment also applies to section 6.3.4.

Ident: AH/20
Section: 6.4.2
Page/para: Verification rule 21
Comment: Typo: "one of corresponding".


Ident: AH/21
Section: 7.1.3
Page/para: Legality rule 5
Comment: We decided to remove the "Integrity" aspect if Secunet confirmed they didn't need it. Was this discussed in the meeting in Paris?

Ident: AH/22
Section: 7.1.3
Page/para: Static semantics bullet 4 (counting manually)
Comment: Typo: It seems wrong to have a rule in square brackets. It suggests it isn't relly a rule.

Ident: AH/23
Section: 10
Page/para: Opening para.
Comment: The opening para doesn't appear to be a complete intro to the section or a definition that is particularly relevant to just this section.

Ident: AH/24
Section: 11.1
Page/para: Requirement
Comment: This high-level requirement and rationale don't justify the need to raise exceptions, in fact the rationale implies that we shouldn't!

Ident: AH/25
Section: 11.2
Page/para: Second para of legality rules
Comment: The second para appears to contain a contradiction "Raise expressions are not in SPARK 2014; for a raise statement to be in SPARK 2014" unless there is a subtlety to the terms "raise expression" and "raise statement" that I'm not aware of.

Ident: AH/26
Section: Appendix A
Page/para: NA
Comment: This section has not been reviewed by the review team. Recommend that it is either reviewed by the authors and updated or excluded from the version that goes to the advisory panel.

Ident: AH/27
Section: General
Page/para: NA
Comment: I've just realised that I've read some detail on Ghost Functions but didn't see anything on Ghost Types and Ghost Variables.

Ident: AH/28
Section: General
Page/para: NA
Comment: [M213-043] has been discussing whether or not a global aspect must always be put in place manually whenever there is a depends aspect that references globals. The conclusion of this discussion may affect the RM.
