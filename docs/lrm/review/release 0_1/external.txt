Comment: There is no description of what is captured under the subheading "Checked by Proof" although this appears in the body of the document.

Section: 1.6
Page/para: page 6
Comment: The list of reasons for using restrictions might be easier to read if presented as a list. 
The penultimate and final items have connectives but these are different ("and" and "or" respectively).
It might read better if the "and" is removed.

Comment: "does not add any declaration or type to Ada 2012" would read better using plural for "declarations" and "types".

Section: 4.1
Page/para: page 13
Comment: This section does not indicate whether the contents of LRM sections 4.1.5 User-Defined References (generalised_reference)
or section 4.1.6 User-defined indexing (generalised_indexing) are included in SPARK 2014. Suggest including sections with these numbers to explicitly exclude or include these features.

Section: Generally
Page/para: 
Comment: Where the SPARK Syntax differs from Ada2012 it might be clearer to present the SPARK 2014 Syntax explicitly 
(what would be great would be to show it as a red-line of the Ada2012 Syntax so that removed items are struck through).
This would often be easier to interpret than the textual description of the restriction (although any motivation for the restriction would be of benefit.

Section: 4.3.4
Page/para: 
Comment: This section is poorly structured - it appears to be a SPARK2014 extention but there is no Syntax subheading and the text would be easier to read if broken down into 
Legality rules, Semantics etc.

Section: 5.5
Page/para: 
Comment: The loop syntax is restricted by the elimination of iterator_specification this is not clear at the point where the Ada Syntax is presented. 
Might be helpful to present the restriction to the syntax here rather than eliminating the subsection that describes iterator_specification. (5.5.2).

Section: 6.1.4
Page/para: page 27, Static Semantics item 5, final bullet
Comment: The final definition of independence seems incomplete - does this mean that Y and Y(J) are independent or 
Y(I) and Y(I) are independent and that Y(I) and Y(J) are independent when indexes I and J evaluate to the same value.
Status: Detail on independence no longer needed. [JIB]

Comment: You need to be careful about modes and effective modes. Here I think you are refering to effective modes but then Proof is only a mode_Selector value not an effective mode.

Section: 6.1.7
Page/para: page 33, Legality Rules
Comment: You need to be careful with the wording here. From the Syntax import_lists only  occur within a conditional_dependency but I expect the 
constraints apply more widely to any imports in any dependency_list.
Status: This has been corrected during the removal of detail on conditional dependencies. [JIB]

Comment: It would be very useful to list the packages supported by SPARK 2014. 
Status: 


Ident: EXT-JEB49
Section: Appendix A
Page/para: General 
Comment: Some of the features of Ada which are now permitted were restricted from SPARK95 because the code was potentially harder to read - 
ie. a reviewer or coder might misinterpret even though the compiler will always interpret the code unambiguously. One such example is default 
subprogram parameters. I would like to be clear whether the restrictions listed are mandetory for the code to be considered SPARK 2014.
I think it will be important to provide off-the-shelf profiles that use an appropriate set of restrictions for various contexts. It would probably
be useful to claim that certain profiles will make the code easier to review - would be good for a safety argument.

Section: 4.1.3
Page/para: 
Comment: The phrase "Some constructs which ..." is not followed up with a clear list of which exceptions are
or are not determined by static analysis. Is this an area which we need to clarify once we know what we can
and can not check?
Status: 


Ident: EXT-AH62
Section: 4.1.4
Page/para: 
Comment: The second paragraph states "... may also be useful in SPARK 2014". Do you mean that it isn't currently included in SPARK 2014 but could be? Or that it is a useful attribute that SPARK 2014 developers can use to check validity of data? Consider rewording to make this clear.
Status: 


Ident: EXT-AH63
Section: 4.3.3
Page/para: 
Comment: It would be nice to make it clear at the beginning here that the Update attribute is an extension of Ada 2012 for SPARK 2014 that can only be used within SPARK aspects (assuming my understanding matches the intention). This comment also applies generally (e.g. section 5.5.3 also introduces constructs rather than restricting them). Thinking about this a little more, if SPARK 2014 adds attributes with dynamic semantics then other compiler vendors would have to sign up to meet SPARK 2014 LRM as well as Ada 2012 LRM. In other words, SPARK 2014 programs can not be compiled with Ada 2012 compilers.

Ident: EXT-AH64
Section: Annex A
Page/para: 
Comment: This is titled Restrictions and Profiles but it doesn't define any profiles. A "profile" is a specific set of restrictions that a user chooses so shouldn't this doc say that the definition of profiles is out of scope, but the definition of restrictions is.

Page/para: 
Comment: For language constructs added for SPARK 2014 there is normally a section titled "Verification Rules" but we don't have these for any standard Ada 2012 constructs. Should we add these? It would be nice to be able to trace all VCs back to a verification rule in this doc.

Section: General
Page/para: 
Comment: Looking at section 6.1.6 "Param Aspects" my initial thought was: "do we really need this?" Is there anywhere where we've documented why we feel our customers really want this kind of thing? I don't see this functionality being required to support the design goals so I'd expect there to be a clear rationale for it. This is a general comment because I feel there are a number of other areas where we may be planning to do more than we need.
