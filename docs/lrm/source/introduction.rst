Introduction
============

|SPARK| is a programming language and a set of verification tools
designed to meet the needs of high-assurance software development.
|SPARK| is based on Ada 2012, both subsetting the language to remove
features that defy verification and also extending the system of
contracts by defining new Ada aspects to support modular,
constructive, formal verification.

The new aspects support the analysis of incomplete programs,
abstraction and refinement and facilitate deep static analysis to be
performed including information-flow analysis and formal verification
of an implementation against a specification.

Meaningful static analysis is possible on complete programs without
the |SPARK| specific aspects and pragmas (for programs which are
otherwise within the |SPARK| subset), in fact the formal verification
of an implementation against a specification of a complete program is
possible using only the Ada 2012 contracts.  Without the |SPARK|
specific aspects, however, analysis has to be performed on a completed
program and cannot be applied constructively during its development.

|SPARK| is a much larger and more flexible language than its
predecessor SPARK 2005. The language can be configured to suit
a number of application domains and standards, from server-class
high-assurance systems to embedded, hard real-time, critical systems.

A major feature of |SPARK| is the support for a mixture of proof and
other verification methods such as testing, which
facilitates the use of unit proof in place of unit testing; an approach now
formalized in DO-178C and the DO-333 formal methods supplement.
Certain units may be formally proven and other units validated through
testing.

Ada 2012 introduced executable contracts such as Pre and Post
conditions and new types of expression, in particular conditional
expressions and quantifiers. |SPARK| uses these contracts and
expressions and extends them with new aspects and pragmas.

The new aspects defined for |SPARK| all have equivalent pragmas which
allows a |SPARK| program to be compiled by and executed by any Ada
implementation; for instance an Ada 95 compiler provided that the use
of Ada 2005 and Ada 2012 specific features is avoided. The |SPARK|
attributes Update and Loop_Entry can be used only if the Ada
implementation supports them.

The direct use of the new aspects requires an Ada 2012 compiler which
supports them in a way consistent with the definition given here in
the |SPARK| reference manual.  The GNAT implementation is one such
compiler.

As with the Ada 2012 contracts, the new |SPARK| aspects and pragmas
have executable semantics and may be executed at run time.  An
expression in an Ada contract or |SPARK| aspect or pragma is called an
*assertion expression* and it is the ability to execute such
expressions which facilitates the mix of proof and testing.

The run-time checking of assertion expressions may be suppressed by
using the Ada pragma Assertion_Policy but the static analysis and
proof tools always use the assertion expressions whatever the
assertion policy.

A special feature of |SPARK| is that numbers in assertion expressions
may have extended or "infinite" arithmetic to make it simpler to write
specifications as they can be written without having to consider the
possibility of overflow within the specification.  The numbers may therefore
behave mathematically (see :ref:`exec_sem`).

.. _read_interpret:

How to Read and Interpret this Manual
-------------------------------------

This RM (reference manual) is *not* a tutorial guide
to |SPARK|.  It is intended as a reference guide for
users and implementors of the language.  In this context,
"implementors" includes those producing both compilers and
verification tools.

This manual is written in the style and language of the Ada 2012 RM,
so knowledge of Ada 2012 is assumed.  Chapters 2 through 13 mirror
the structure of the Ada 2012 RM.  Chapters 14 onward cover all the annexes
of the Ada 2012 RM. Moreover, this manual should be interpreted as an extension
of the Ada 2012 RM (that is, |SPARK| is fully defined by this document taken together
with the Ada 2012 RM).

The |SPARK| RM uses and introduces technical terms in its
descriptions, those that are less well known or introduced are
summarized in a :ref:`glossary` following the sections covering the
Ada annexes.

|SPARK| introduces a number of aspects. The language rules are written as if all
the |SPARK| specific aspects are present but minimum requirements are placed on
a tool which analyzes |SPARK| to be able to synthesize (from the source code)
some of these aspects if they are not present. A tool may synthesize more
aspects than the minimum required (see :ref:`verific_modes`). An equivalent
pragma is available for each of the new aspects but these are not covered
explicitly in the language rules either.  The pragmas used by |SPARK| are
documented in :ref:`language_defined_pragmas`.


Readers interested in how SPARK 2005 constructs and idioms map into
|SPARK| should consult the appendix :ref:`mapping-spec-label`.

.. _desc_notate:

Method of Description
---------------------

In expressing the aspects, pragmas, attributes and rules of |SPARK|,
the following chapters of this document follow the notational conventions of
the Ada 2012 RM (section 1.1.4).

The following sections are given for each new language feature introduced
for |SPARK|, following the Ada 2012 RM (other than *Verification Rules*,
which is specific to |SPARK|):

#. Syntax: this section gives the format of any |SPARK| specific syntax.

#. Legality Rules: these are rules that are enforced at compile time. A
   construct is legal if it obeys *all* of the Legality Rules.

#. Static Semantics: a definition of the compile-time effect of each construct.

#. Dynamic Semantics: a definition of the run-time effect of each construct.

#. Verification Rules: these rules define checks to be performed on the language
   feature that relate to static analysis rather than simple legality rules.

#. Name Resolution Rules: There are very few |SPARK| specific name resolution
   rules.  Where they exist they are placed under this heading.

A section might not be present if there are no rules specific to |SPARK|
associated with the language feature.

When presenting rules, additional text may be provided in square brackets [ ].
This text is redundant in terms of defining the rules themselves and simply provides
explanatory detail.

In addition, examples of the use of the new features are given along with the
language definition detail.

.. _formal_analysis:

Formal Analysis
---------------

|SPARK| will be amenable to a range of formal analyses, including but not
limited to the following static analysis techniques:

- Data-flow analysis, which considers the initialization of variables and the
  data dependencies of subprograms (which parameters and variables get read or
  written).

- Information-flow analysis, which also considers the coupling between the
  inputs and outputs of a subprogram (which input values of parameters and
  variables influence which output values). The term *flow analysis* is used to
  mean data-flow analysis and information-flow analysis taken together.

- Formal verification of robustness properties. In Ada terminology, this refers to
  the proof that certain predefined checks, such as the ones which could raise
  Constraint_Error, will never fail at run time and hence the corresponding exceptions
  will not be raised.

- Formal verification of functional properties, based on contracts expressed as
  preconditions, postconditions, type invariants and so on. The term *formal verification*
  is used to mean formal verification of robustness properties and formal verification of
  functional properties taken together.

Data and information-flow analysis is not valid and might not be possible if the
legality rules of Ada 2012 and those presented in this document are not met.
Similarly, a formal verification might not be possible if the legality rules are
not met and may be unsound if data-flow errors are present.

Further Details on Formal Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many Ada constructs have dynamic semantics which include a requirement
that some error condition must or may\ [#bounded_errors]_ be checked,
and some exception  must or may\ [#bounded_errors]_  be raised, if the error is
detected  (see Ada 2012 RM 1.1.5(5-8)).  For example, evaluating the name of an
array component includes a check that each index value belongs to the
corresponding index range of the array (see Ada 2012 RM 4.1.1(7)).

For every such run-time check a corresponding obligation to prove that the error
condition cannot be true is introduced. In particular, this rule applies to the
run-time checks associated with any assertion (see Ada 2012 RM (11.4.2));
the one exception to this rule is pragma
``Assume`` (see :ref:`pragma_assume`).

In addition, the generation of verification conditions is unaffected by the
suppression of checks (e.g., via pragma ``Suppress``) or the disabling of
assertions (e.g., via pragma ``Assertion_Policy``). In other words, suppressing
or disabling a check does not prevent generation of its associated verification
conditions. Similarly, the verification conditions generated to ensure the
absence of numeric overflow for operations of a floating point type T
are unaffected by the value of T'Machine_Overflows.

All such generated verification conditions must be discharged before the
formal program verification phase may be considered to be complete.

.. [#bounded_errors] In the case of some bounded errors, performing
   a check (and raising an exception if the check fails) is permitted
   but not required.

A |SPARK| implementation has the option of treating any construct which would
otherwise generate an unsatisfiable verification condition as illegal, even
if the construct will never be executed. For example, a |SPARK| implementation
might reject the declaration

.. code-block:: ada

   X : Positive := 0;

in almost any context. [Roughly speaking, if it can be
determined statically that a runtime check associated with some construct
will inevitably fail whenever the construct is elaborated,
then the implementation is  allowed (but not required) to reject
the construct just as if the construct violated a legality rule.]
For purposes of this rule, the
Ada rule that Program_Error is raised if a function "completes normally
without executing a return statement" is treated as a check associated
with the end of the function body's sequence_of_statements. [This
treatment gives |SPARK| implementations the option of imposing simpler
(but more conservative) rules to ensure that the end of a function is
not reachable. Strictly speaking, this rule gives |SPARK| implementations
the option of rejecting many things that should not be rejected (e.g.,
"pragma Assert (False);" in an unreachable arm of a case statement);
reasonable implementations will not misuse this freedom.]

Formal verification of a program may depend on properties of
either the machine on which it is to be executed or on properties
of the tools used to compile and build it. For example, a program
might depend on the bounds of the type Standard.Long_Integer or on
the implementation-dependent bounds chosen for the unconstrained
base subtype associated with a declaration like "type T is range 1 .. 10;".
In such cases it must be possible to provide the needed information
as explicit inputs to the formal verification process.
The means by which this is accomplished is not specified as part of
the |SPARK| language definition.

.. _exec_sem:

Executable Contracts and Mathematical Numbers
---------------------------------------------

Contracts, in the form of assertion expressions, are executable in Ada
and |SPARK| and have the same semantics in both.  The new aspects and
pragmas introduced by |SPARK| where they are assertion expressions
are also executable.  Executable contracts have a number of advantages
but also a few drawbacks that |SPARK| to a large extent mitigates.

The Ada pragma Assertion_Policy controls whether contracts and
assertion expressions in general are executed and checked at run-time.
Assertion expressions are always significant in static analysis and
proof and, indeed, form the basis of the specification against which
the implementation is verified.

In summary, Ada 2012 in itself enables contract-based, dynamic
verification of complex properties of a program.  |SPARK| enables
contract-based static deductive verification of a large subset of Ada
2012.


The Advantages of Executable Contracts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The possibility of making assertions and contracts executable benefits
the programmer in a number of ways:

  * it gives the programmer a gentle introduction to the use of
    contracts, and encourages the development of assertions and code
    in parallel. This is natural when both are expressed in the same
    programming language;

  * executable assertions can be enabled and checked at run time, and
    this gives valuable information to the user. When an assertion
    fails, it means that the code failed to obey desired properties
    (i.e., the code is erroneous), or that the intent of the code has
    been incorrectly expressed (i.e., the assertion is erroneous) and
    experience shows that both situations arise equally often. In any
    case, the understanding of the code and properties of the
    programmer are improved. This also means that users get immediate
    benefits from writing additional assertions and contracts, which
    greatly encourages the adoption of contract-based programming;

  * contracts can be written and dynamically verified even when the
    contracts or the program are too complex for automatic proof. This
    includes programs that explicitly manipulate pointers, for
    example.

Executable contracts can be less expressive than pure mathematical
ones, or more difficult to write in some situations but |SPARK| has
features to largely mitigate these issues as described in the
following subsections.

Mathematical Numbers and Arithmetic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Ada numeric overflow may occur when evaluating an assertion
expression this adds to the complexity of writing contracts and
specifications using them, for instance, the expression

::

  Post => X = (Y + Z) / 100

might raise a run-time exception if Y is an integer and Y + Z >
Integer'Last even if the entire expression is less then Integer'Last.

|SPARK| mandates that there is an operational mode where such
expressions (at least for Integer types) are treated as mathematical
and the above expression shall not overflow and will not raise an
exception.  In this mode the assertion expressions may still be
executable and use extended or infinite precision numbers.  This mode
might be acceptable if assertion expressions are not to be executed in
the delivered code or if the overhead of executing contracts is not an
issue.

If the mode is not chosen, then |SPARK| requires checks that have to
be proven to demonstrate that an overflow cannot occur.  In the above
example the checks would not be provable and the postcondition would
have to be rewritten something like:

::

  Post => X = Integer ((Long_Integer (Y) + Long_Integer (Z)) / 100)

The way in which this operational mode is selected is tool dependent
and shall be described in the user manual accompanying the tool.

Libraries for Specification and Proof
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is intended that |SPARK| will have available libraries (as
packages) of common paradigms such as sets that might be difficult to
express in executable contracts but the underlying model of the
library packages will have a more expressive specification along with
axioms that will make automatic proof of (executable) contracts using
these libraries practical.

.. _dynamic_sem:

Dynamic Semantics of |SPARK| Programs
-------------------------------------

Every valid |SPARK| program is also a valid Ada 2012 program, although
for a general Ada 2012 compiler, |SPARK| specific aspects may have to
be replaced by their equivalent pragmas.  The |SPARK| dynamic
semantics are the same as Ada 2012 with the exception of some new
aspects, pragmas and attributes which have dynamic semantics and the
mathematical arithmetic in assertion expressions. Additionally, the new
dynamic semantics only affect assertion expressions so if assertion
expressions are ignored then the dynamic semantics of an Ada 2012
program are the same as a |SPARK| program.

|SPARK| programs that have failed their static analysis checks can still be
valid Ada 2012 programs. An incorrect |SPARK| program with, say, flow
analysis anomalies or undischarged verification conditions can still be executed as
long as the Ada compiler in question finds nothing objectionable. What one gives
up in this case is the formal analysis of the program, such as proof of absence
of run-time errors or the static checks performed by flow analysis such as the
proof that all variables are initialized before use.

|SPARK| may make use of certain aspects, attributes and pragmas which are not
defined in the Ada 2012 reference manual. Ada 2012 explicitly permits
implementations to provide implementation-defined aspects, attributes and
pragmas. If a |SPARK| program uses one of these aspects (e.g., Global), or
attributes (e.g., Update) then it can only be compiled and executed by an
implementation which supports the construct in a way consistent with the
definition given here in the |SPARK| reference manual.

If the equivalent pragmas are used instead of the
implementation-defined aspects and if the use of
implementation-defined attributes is avoided, then a |SPARK| program
may be compiled and executed by any Ada implementation (whether or not
it recognizes the |SPARK| pragmas). Ada specifies that unrecognized
pragmas are ignored: an Ada compiler that ignores the pragma is
correctly implementing the dynamic semantics of |SPARK| and the
|SPARK| tools will still be able to undertake all their static checks
and proofs.  If an Ada compiler defines a pragma with the same name as
a |SPARK| specific pragma but has different semantics, then the
compilation or execution of the program may fail.

Main Program
------------

There is no aspect or pragma in |SPARK| indicating that a subprogram
is a main program.  Instead it is expected that any implementation of
|SPARK| will have its own mechanism to allow the tools to identify the
main program (albeit not within the language itself).

.. _sprs:

|SPARK| Strategic Requirements
------------------------------

The following requirements give the principal goals to be met by |SPARK|.
Some are expanded in subsequent sections within this chapter.

- The |SPARK| language subset shall embody the largest subset of Ada 2012 to
  which it is currently practical to apply automatic formal verification, in line with
  the goals below. However, future advances in verification research and
  computing power may allow for expansion of the language and the forms of
  verification available. See section :ref:`main_restricts`
  for further details.

- The use of Ada 2012 preconditions, postconditions and other assertions
  dictates that |SPARK| shall have executable semantics for assertion
  expressions. Such expressions may be executed, proven or both. To avoid having
  to consider potential numeric overflows when defining an assertion expression
  |SPARK| mandates a mode whereby extended or infinite integer arithmetic is
  supported for assertion expressions. The way in which this mode is selected is
  tool dependent and shall be described in the user guide for the tool. If this
  mode is not active, verification conditions to demonstrate the absence of overflow
  in assertion expressions will be present.

- |SPARK| shall provide for mixing of verification evidence generated by formal
  analysis [for code written in the |SPARK| subset] and evidence generated by
  testing or other traditional means [for code written outside of the core
  |SPARK| language, including legacy Ada code, or code written in the |SPARK|
  subset for which verification evidence could not be generated]. See section
  :ref:`test_and_proof` for further details. Note, however, that a core goal of
  is to provide a language expressive enough for the whole of a program
  to be written in |SPARK|, making it potentially entirely provable largely
  using automatic proof tools.

- |SPARK| shall support *constructive*, modular development which allows
  contracts to be specified on the declaration of program units and allows
  analysis and verification to be performed based on these contracts as early as
  possible in the development lifecycle, even before the units are
  implemented. As units are implemented the implementation is verified against
  its specification given in its contract. The contracts are specified using
  |SPARK| specific aspects.

- A |SPARK| analysis tool is required to synthesize at least some of the |SPARK|
  specific aspects, used to specify the contract of a program unit, if a
  contract is not explicitly specified, for instance the :ref:`global-aspects`
  and the :ref:`depends-aspects` from the implementation of the unit if it
  exists. The minimum requirements are given in :ref:`verific_modes` but a
  particular tool may provide more precise synthesis and the synthesis of more
  aspects. The synthesized aspect is used in the analysis of the unit if the
  aspect is not explicitly specified. The synthesis of |SPARK| specific aspects
  facilitates different development strategies and the analysis of pre-existing
  code (see section :ref:`verific_modes`).

- Although a goal of |SPARK| is to provide a language that supports as many
  Ada 2012 features as practical, there is another goal which is to support good
  programming practice guidelines and coding standards applicable to certain
  domains or standards. This goal is met either by standard Ada Restrictions and
  Profile pragmas, or via existing tools (e.g., pragma Restriction_Warnings in
  GNAT, or the coding standard checker gnatcheck).

- |SPARK| shall allow the mixing of code written in the |SPARK| subset
  with code written in full Ada 2012. See section :ref:`in_out` for
  further details.

- Many systems are not written in a single programming language. |SPARK| shall
  support the development, analysis and verification of programs which are only
  partly in |SPARK|, with other parts in another language, for instance, C.
  |SPARK| specific aspects manually specified at unit level will form the
  boundary interface between the |SPARK| and other parts of the program.

- |SPARK| shall support entities which do not affect the functionality of
  a program but may be used in the test and verification of a program.
  See section :ref:`Adding Code for Specification and Verification`.

- |SPARK| shall provide counterparts of all language features and
  analysis modes provided in SPARK 83/95/2005, unless it has been
  identified that customers do not find them useful.

- Enhanced support for specifying and verifying properties of secure systems
  shall be provided (over what is available in SPARK 2005). [The features to
  provide this enhanced support are not yet fully defined and will not be
  implemented until after release 1 of the |SPARK| tools.]

- |SPARK| shall support the analysis of external communication channels, which
  are typically implemented using volatile variables.
  See section :ref:`volatile` for further details.

- The language shall offer an unambiguous semantics. In Ada
  terminology, this means that all erroneous and unspecified behaviour
  shall be eliminated either by direct exclusion or by adding rules
  which indirectly guarantee that some implementation-dependent
  choice, other than the fundamental data types and constants, cannot
  effect the externally-visible behaviour of the program. For example,
  Ada does not specify the order in which actual parameters are
  evaluated as part of a subprogram call. As a result of the SPARK
  rules which prevent the evaluation of an expression from having side
  effects, two implementations might choose different parameter
  evaluation orders for a given call but this difference won't have
  any observable effect. [This means undefined, implementation-defined and
  partially-specified features may be outside of |SPARK| by
  definition, though their use could be allowed and a warning or error
  generated for the user. See section :ref:`in_out` for further
  details.] Where the possibility of ambiguity still exists it is
  noted, namely the reading of an invalid value from an external
  source and the use of Unchecked_Conversion, otherwise There are no
  known ambiguities in the language presented in this document.

- |SPARK| shall support provision of "formal analysis" as defined by DO-333,
  which states "an analysis method can only be regarded as formal analysis if
  its determination of a property is sound. Sound analysis means that the method
  never asserts a property to be true when it is not true." A language with
  unambiguous semantics is required to achieve this and additionally any other
  language feature that for which sound analysis is difficult or impractical
  will be eliminated or its use constrained to meet this goal. See section
  :ref:`main_restricts` for further details.

.. _explain_sprs:

Explaining the Strategic Requirements
----------------------------------------

The following sections provide expanded detail on the main strategic requirements.

.. _main_restricts:

Principal Language Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To facilitate formal analyses and verification, |SPARK| enforces a number of
global restrictions to Ada 2012. While these are covered in more detail
in the remaining chapters of this document, the most notable restrictions are:

- Restrictions on the use of access types and values, similar in some
  ways to the ownership model of the programming language Rust.

- All expressions (including function calls) are free of side-effects.

- Aliasing of names is not permitted in general but the renaming of entities is
  permitted as there is a static relationship between the two names.  In
  analysis all names introduced by a renaming declaration are replaced by the
  name of the renamed entity. This replacement is applied recursively when there
  are multiple renames of an entity.

- The goto statement is not permitted.

- The use of controlled types is not currently permitted.

- Tasks and protected objects are permitted only if the Ravenscar profile
  (or the Extended Ravenscar profile) is specified.

- Raising and handling of exceptions is not currently permitted (exceptions can
  be included in a program but proof must be used to show that they cannot be
  raised).


.. _test_and_proof:

Combining Formal Verification and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are common reasons for combining formal verification on some part
of a codebase and testing on the rest of the codebase:

#. Formal verification is only applicable to a part of the codebase. For
   example, it might not be possible to apply the necessary formal verification to Ada code
   that is not in |SPARK|.

#. Formal verification only gives strong enough results on a part of the
   codebase. This might be because the desired properties cannot be expressed
   formally, or because proof of these desired properties cannot be
   sufficiently automated.

#. Formal verification might be only cost-effective on a part of the codebase. (And
   it may be more cost-effective than testing on this part of the codebase.)

Since the combination of formal verification and testing cannot guarantee the
same level of assurance as when formal verification alone is used, the goal
when combining formal verification and testing is to
reach a level of confidence at least as good as the level reached by testing alone.

Mixing of formal verification and testing requires consideration of at least the
following three issues.

Demarcating the Boundary between Formally Verified and Tested Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contracts on subprograms provide a natural boundary for this combination. If a
subprogram is proved to respect its contract, it should be possible to call it
from a tested subprogram. Conversely, formal verification of a subprogram
(including absence of run-time errors and contract checking) depends on called
subprograms respecting their own contracts, whether these are verified by
formal verification or testing.

In cases where the code to be tested is not |SPARK|, then additional information
may be provided in the code -- possibly at the boundary -- to indicate this
(see section :ref:`in_out` for further details).


Checks to be Performed at the Boundary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a tested subprogram T calls a proved subprogram P, then the precondition
of P must hold. Assurance that this is true is generated by executing
the assertion that P's precondition holds during the testing of T.

Similarly, when a proved subprogram P calls a tested subprogram T, formal
verification will have shown that the precondition of T holds. Hence, testing
of T must show that the postcondition of T holds by executing the corresponding
assertion.  This is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
Dynamically, there is no check that the subprogram has not updated entities
not included in the postcondition.

In general, formal verification works by imposing requirements on the callers of
proved code, and these requirements should be shown to hold even when formal
verification and testing are combined. Any tool set that proposes a combination
of formal verification and testing for |SPARK| should provide a detailed process
for doing so, including any necessary additional testing of proof assumptions.

Conditions that Apply to the Tested Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The unit of test and formal verification is a subprogram (the sequence
of statements of a package body is regarded as a subprogram).
There are several sources of conditions that apply to a tested subprogram:

- The need to validate a partial proof of a subprogram that calls a
  subprogram that is not itself proven but is only tested.

- The need to validate the assumptions on which a proof of a
  subprogram is based when a tested subprogram calls it.

- A tested subprogram may be flow analyzed if it is in |SPARK| even if
  it is not formally proven.

- A tested subprogram may have properties that are formally proven.

Flow analysis of a non-proven subprogram
########################################

If a subprogram is in |SPARK| but is too complex or difficult to prove
formally then it still may be flow analyzed which is a fast and
efficient process.  Flow analysis in the absence proof of has a number
of significant benefits as the subprogram implementation is

- checked that it is in |SPARK|;

- checked that there are no uses of initialized variables;

- checked that there are no ineffective statements; and

- checked against its specified Global and Depends aspects if they
  exist or alternatively facilitating their synthesis.  This is
  important because this automatically checks one of the conditions on
  tested subprograms which are called from proven code (see
  :ref:`tested_from_proven`).

Proving properties of a tested subprogram
#########################################

A tested subprogram which is in SPARK may have properties, such as the
absence of run-time exceptions proven even though the full
functionality of the subprogram is tested rather than proven.  The
extent to which proof is performed is controlled using pragma Assume
(see :ref:`pragma_assume`).

To perform proof of absence of run-time exceptions but not the
postcondition of a subprogram a pragma Assume stating the
postcondition is placed immediately prior to each exit point from the
subprogram (each return statement or the end of the body).  Parts of
the postcondition may be proved using a similar scheme.

If the proof of absence of one or more run-time exceptions is not
proven automatically or takes too long to prove then pragma Assume may
be used to suppress the proof of a particular check.

Pragma Assume informs the proof system that the assumed expression is
always True and so the prover does not attempt to prove it.  In
general pragma Assume should be used with caution but it acts as a
pragma Assert when the subprogram code is run.  Therefore, in a
subprogram that is tested it acts as an extra test.

.. _tested_from_proven:

Conditions on a tested subprogram which is called from a partially proven subprogram
####################################################################################

When a subprogram which is to be partially proven calls a tested
(but not proven subprogram) then the following conditions must be met
by the called subprogram:

- if it is in |SPARK| then it should be flow analyzed to demonstrate
  that the implementation satisfies the Global aspect and Depends
  aspects pf the subprogram if they are given, otherwise conservative
  approximations will be synthesized from the implementation of
  the subprogram;

- if it is not in |SPARK| then at least a Global aspect shall be
  specified for the subprogram.  The Global aspect must truthfully
  represent the global variables and state abstractions known to the
  |SPARK| program (not just the calling subprogram) and specify
  whether each of the global items are an Input, an Output or is
  In_Out.  The onus is on the user to show that the Global (and
  Depends) aspect is correct as the |SPARK| tools do not check this
  because the subprogram is not in |SPARK|;

- it shall not update any variable or state abstraction known to the
  |SPARK| program, directly or indirectly, apart from through an
  actual parameter of the subprogram or a global item listed in its
  Global aspect.  Updating a variable or state abstraction through an
  object of an access type or through a subprogram call is an indirect
  update. Here again, if the subprogram is not in |SPARK| and cannot
  be flow analyzed, the onus is on the user to show this condition is
  met; and

- if it has a postcondition sufficient testing to demonstrate to a
  high-level of confidence that the postcondition is always True must
  be performed.

A tool set may provide further tools to demonstrate that the Global
aspects are satisfied by a non-|SPARK| subprogram and possibly
partially check the post condition.

Conditions on a tested subprogram which is calls a proven subprogram
####################################################################

A tested (but not proven) subprogram which calls a proven subprogram
must satisfy the following conditions:

- if it is in |SPARK| then flow analysis of the tested subprogram
  should be performed.  This demonstrates that all variables and state
  abstractions which are inputs to the called subprogram are
  initialized and that the outputs of the called subprogram are used;

- if it is not in |SPARK| the user must ensure that all variables and
  state abstractions that are inputs to the called subprogram are
  initialized prior to calling the subprogram.  This is the
  responsibility of the user as the |SPARK| tools cannot check this as
  the subprogram is not in |SPARK|; and

- if it is in |SPARK| it may be possible to prove that the
  precondition of the called subprogram is always satisfied even if no
  other proof is undertaken, otherwise sufficient testing must be
  performed by the user to demonstrate to a high-level of confidence
  that the precondition of the subprogram will always be True when the
  subprogram is called.  The proof of the called subprogram relies on
  its precondition evaluating to True.

.. _Adding Code for Specification and Verification:

Adding Code for Specification and Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often extra entities, such as types, variables and functions may be required
only for test and verification purposes. Such entities are termed *ghost*
entities and their use is restricted so that they do not affect
the functionality of the program. Complete removal of *ghost* entities has no
functional impact on the program.

|SPARK| supports ghost subprograms, types, objects, and packages.
Ghost subprograms may be executable or non-executable.
Non-executable ghost subprograms have no implementation
and can be used for the purposes of formal verification only. Such
functions may have their specification defined within an external
proof tool to facilitate formal verification. This specification is
outside of the |SPARK| language and toolset and therefore cannot be
checked by the tools. An incorrect definition of function may lead to
an unsound proof which is of no use. Ideally any definition will be
checked for soundness by the external proof tools.

If the postcondition of a function, F, can be specified in |SPARK| as
F'Result = E, then the postcondition may be recast as the expression of an
``expression_function_declaration`` as shown below:

.. code-block:: ada

  function F (V : T) return T1 is (E);

The default postcondition of an expression function is F'Result = E making E
both the implementation and the expression defining the postcondition of the
function. This is useful, particularly for ghost functions, as the expression
which acts as the postcondition might not give the most efficient implementation
but if the function is a ghost function this might not matter.

.. _verific_modes:

Synthesis of |SPARK| Aspects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|SPARK| supports a *constructive* analysis style where all program units
require contracts specified by |SPARK| specific aspects to be provided on their
declarations. Under this constructive analysis style, these contracts have to
be designed and added at an early stage to assist modular analysis and
verification, and then maintained by the user as a program evolves. When the
body of a unit is implemented (or modified) it is checked that it conforms to
its contract. However, it is mandated that a |SPARK| analysis tool shall be able
to synthesize a conservative approximation of at least a minimum of |SPARK|
specific aspects from the source code of a unit.

Synthesis of |SPARK| aspects is fundamental to the analysis
of pre-existing code where no |SPARK| specific aspects are provided.

A |SPARK| analysis tool is required to be
capable of synthesizing at least a basic, conservative :ref:`global-aspects`,
:ref:`depends-aspects`, :ref:`refined-global-aspect`,
:ref:`refined-depends-aspect`, :ref:`abstract-state-aspect`,
:ref:`refined_state_aspect`, :ref:`initializes_aspect` and
:ref:`default_initial_condition_aspect` from either the
implementation code or from other |SPARK| aspects as follows:

  * if subprogram has no Depends aspect but has a Global aspect, an
    approximation of the Depends aspect is obtained by constructing a
    ``dependency_relation`` by assuming that each output is dependent on every
    input, where outputs are all of the parameters of mode out and in-out, plus
    all the ``global_items`` that have a ``mode_selector`` of Output or In_Out,
    and inputs are all the parameters of mode in and in-out, plus all the
    ``global_items`` that have a ``mode_selector`` of Input or In_Out. This is
    a conservative approximation;

  * if a subprogram has a Depends aspect but no Global aspect then the Global
    aspect is determined by taking each ``input`` of the ``dependency_relation``
    which is not also an ``output`` and adding this to the Global aspect with a
    ``mode_selector`` of Input. Each ``output`` of the ``dependency_relation``
    which is not also an ``input`` is added to the Global aspect with a
    ``mode_selector`` of Output. Finally, any other ``input`` and ``output`` of
    the ``dependency_relation`` which has not been added to the Global aspect is
    added with a ``mode_selector`` of In_Out;

  * if neither a Global or Depends aspect is present, then first the globals of
    a subprogram are determined from an analysis of the entire program code.
    This is achieved in some tool dependent way. The globals of each subprogram
    determined from this analysis is used to synthesize the Global aspects and
    then from these the Depends aspects are synthesized as described above;

  * if an Abstract_State is specified on a package and a Refined_State aspect is
    specified in its body, then Refined_Global and Refined_Depends aspects shall
    be synthesized in the same way as described above. From the Refined_Global,
    Refined_Depends and Refined_State aspects the abstract Global and Depends
    shall be synthesized if they are not present.

  * if no abstract state aspect is specified on a package but it contains hidden
    state, then each variable that makes up the hidden state has a
    Abstract_State synthesized to represent it. At least a crude approximation of
    a single state abstraction for every variable shall be provided. A
    Refined_State aspect shall be synthesized which shows the constituents of
    each state.

  * if no Default_Initial_Condition is specified for a private type declaration,
    then the synthesized value of this aspect of the type is determined
    by whether the full view of the private type defines full default
    initialization (see SPARK RM 3.1). If it does, then the synthesized
    aspect value is a static *Boolean_*\ ``expression`` having
    the value True; if it does not, then the synthesized aspect value
    is a null literal.

The syntheses described above do not include all of the |SPARK| aspects and nor
do the syntheses cover all facets of the aspects. In complex programs where
extra or more precise aspects are required they might have to be specified
manually.

An analysis tool may provide the synthesis of more aspects and more precise
synthesis of the mandatory ones.

Some use cases where the synthesis of aspects is likely to be required are:

- Code has been developed as |SPARK| but not all the aspects are included on all
  subprograms by the developer. This is regarded as *generative analysis*, where
  the code was written with the intention that it would be analyzed.

- Code is in maintenance phase, it might or might not have all of the |SPARK|
  specific aspects.  If there are aspects missing they are automatically
  for analysis purposes when possible. This is also regarded as generative
  analysis.

- Legacy code is analyzed which has no or incomplete |SPARK| specific aspects
  This is regarded as *retrospective analysis*, where code is being analyzed
  that was not originally written with analysis in mind. Legacy code will
  typically have a mix of |SPARK| and non-|SPARK| code (and so there is an
  interaction with the detail presented in section :ref:`in_out`).
  This leads to two additional process steps that might be necessary:

  * An automatic identification of what code is in |SPARK| and what is not.

  * Manual definition of the boundary between the |SPARK| and non-|SPARK| code
    by explicitly specifying accurate and truthful contracts using |SPARK|
    specific aspects on the declarations of non-|SPARK| program units.

.. _in_out:

In and Out of |SPARK|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are various reasons why it may be necessary to combine |SPARK| and
non-|SPARK| in the same program, such as (though not limited to):

- Use of language features that are not amenable to formal verification (and hence
  where formal verification will be mixed with testing).

- Use of libraries that are not written in |SPARK|.

- Need to analyze legacy code that was not developed as |SPARK|.

Hence, it must be possible within the language to indicate what parts are
(intended to be) in and what parts are (intended to be) out, of |SPARK|.

The default is to assume none of the program text is in |SPARK|, although this
can be overridden. A new aspect  *SPARK_Mode* is provided, which may be applied to a unit
declaration or a unit body, to indicate when a unit declaration or just its body
is in SPARK and should be analyzed. If just the body is not in |SPARK| a
|SPARK| compatible contract may be supplied on the declaration which facilitates
the analysis of units which use the declaration. The tools cannot check that the
the given contract is met by the body as it is not analyzed. The burden falls
on the user to ensure that the contract represents the behavior of the body as seen by the
|SPARK| parts of the program and -- if this is not the case -- the assumptions
on which the analysis of the |SPARK| code relies may be invalidated.

In general a definition may be in |SPARK| but its completion need not be.

A finer grain of mixing |SPARK| and Ada code is also possible by justifying
certain warnings and errors.  Warnings may be justified at a project, library
unit, unit, and individual warning level.
Errors may be justifiable at the individual error level or be
unsuppressible errors.

Examples of this are:

- A declaration occurring immediately within a unit might not be in, or might
  depend on features not in, the |SPARK| subset. The declaration might generate
  a warning or an error which may be justifiable. This does not necessarily
  render the whole of the program unit not in |SPARK|.  If the declaration
  generates a warning, or if the error is justified, then the unit is considered
  to be in |SPARK| except for the errant declaration.

- It is the use of the entity declared by the errant declaration, for instance
  a call of a subprogram or the denoting of an object in an expression
  (generally within the statements of a body) that will result in an
  unsupressible error. The body of a unit causing the unsuppressible message (or
  declaration if this is the cause) will need to be marked as not in |SPARK| to
  prevent its future analysis.

Hence, |SPARK| and non-|SPARK| code may mix at a fine level of granularity.
The following combinations may be typical:

- Package (or generic package) specification in |SPARK|. Package body entirely
  not in |SPARK|.

- Visible part of package (or generic package) specification in |SPARK|.
  Private part and body not in |SPARK|.

- Package specification in |SPARK|. Package body almost entirely in |SPARK|, with a small
  number of subprogram bodies not in |SPARK|.

- Package specification in |SPARK|, with all bodies imported from another language.

- Package specification contains a mixture of declarations which are in |SPARK|
  and not in |SPARK|.  A client of the package may be in |SPARK| if it only
  references |SPARK| declarations; the presence of non-|SPARK| constructs
  in a referenced package specification does not by itself mean that
  a client is not in SPARK 2014.

Such patterns are intended to allow for mixed-language programming,
mixed-verification using different analysis tools, and mixed-verification
between formal verification and more traditional testing. A condition for
safely combining the results of formal verification with other verification
results is that formal verification tools explicitly list the assumptions that
were made to produce their results. The proof of a property may depend on the
assumption of other user-specified properties (for example, preconditions and
postconditions) or implicit assumptions associated with the foundation and
hypothesis on which the formal verification relies (for example,
initialization of inputs and outputs, or non-aliasing between parameters). When
a complete program is formally verified, these assumptions are discharged by
the proof tools, based on the global guarantees provided by the strict
adherence to a given language subset. No such guarantees are available when
only part of a program is formally verified.  Thus, combining these results
with other verification results depends on the verification of global and local
assumptions made during formal verification.

Full details on the SPARK_Mode aspect are given in the SPARK Toolset User's Guide (*Identifying SPARK Code*).

.. _volatile:

External State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A variable or a state abstraction may be specified as external state to
indicate that it represents an external communication channel, for instance, to
a device or another subsystem. An external variable may be specified as volatile.
A volatile state need not have the same value between two reads without an
intervening update. Similarly an update of a volatile variable might not have any
effect on the internal operation of a program, its only effects are external to
the program. These properties require special treatment of volatile variables
during flow analysis and formal verification.

|SPARK| follows the Ada convention that a read of a volatile variable
may have an external effect as well as reading the value of the
variable.  |SPARK| extends this notion to cover updates of a volatile
variable such that an update of a volatile variable may also have some
other observable effect.  |SPARK| further extends these principles to
apply to state abstractions. (see section :ref:`external_state`).
