Statements
==========

|SPARK| restricts the use of some statements, and adds a number of pragmas which
are used for verification, particularly involving loop statements.

Simple and Compound Statements - Sequences of Statements
--------------------------------------------------------

|SPARK| excludes certain kinds of statements that complicate verification.

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

.. _tu-nt-simple_and_compound_statements-01:

1. A ``simple_statement`` shall not be a ``goto_statement``,
   a ``requeue_statement``, an ``abort_statement``, or a ``code_statement``.

.. _tu-nt-simple_and_compound_statements-02:

2. A ``compound_statement`` shall not be an ``accept_statement``
   or a ``select_statement``.

.. _tu-nt-simple_and_compound_statements-03:

3. A statement is only in |SPARK| if all the constructs used in the
   statement are in |SPARK|.

User-Defined Iterator Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

.. _tu-user_defined_iterator_types-01:

1. The generic package Ada.Iterator_Interfaces shall not be referenced.
   [In particular, Ada.Iterator_Interfaces shall not be instantiated.
   An alternative mechanism for defining iterator types is
   described in the next section.]

.. _etu-user_defined_iterator_types:

.. todo:: Need to consider further the support for iterators and
          whether the application of constant iterators could be
          supported. To be addressed post release 1.

Generalized Loop Iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. centered:: **Static Semantics**

.. _tu-generalized_loop_iteration-01:

1. Ada's generalized loop iteration is supported in |SPARK|,
   but only in a modified form. Ada's existing generalized
   loop iteration is defined in terms of other constructs
   which are not in |SPARK| (e.g., access discriminants).

2. Instead, |SPARK| provides a new mechanism for defining
   an iterable container type (see Ada RM 5.5.1). Iteration
   over the elements of an object of such a type is then
   allowed as for any iterable container type (see Ada RM 5.5.2),
   although with dynamic semantics as described below.
   Similarly, |SPARK| provides a new mechanism for defining
   an iterator type (see Ada RM 5.5.1), which then allows
   generalized iterators as for any iterator type (see Ada RM 5.5.2).
   Other forms of generalized loop iteration are not in |SPARK|.

3. The type-related operational representation aspect Iterable
   may be specified for any non-array type.
   The ``aspect_definition`` for an Iterable aspect specification for
   a subtype of a type T shall follow the following grammar for
   ``iterable_specification``::

     iterable_specification ::=
       (First       => name,
        Next        => name,
        Has_Element => name[,
        Element     => name])

4. If the aspect Iterable is visibly specified for a type,
   the (view of the) type is defined to be an iterator type (view).
   If the aspect Iterable is visibly specified for a type and the
   specification includes an Element argument then
   the (view of the) type is defined to be an iterable container type (view).
   [The visibility of an aspect specification is defined in Ada RM 8.8].
   [Because other iterator types and iterable container types as defined in
   Ada RM 5.5.1 are necessarily not in |SPARK|, this effectively replaces,
   rather than extends, those definitions].

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

5. Each of the four (or three, if the optional argument is omitted)
   names shall denote an explicitly declared primitive function of the
   type, referred to respectively as the First, Next, Has_Element,
   and Element functions of the type. All parameters of all
   four subprograms shall be of mode In.

6. The First function of the type shall take a single parameter,
   which shall be of type T. The "iteration cursor subtype" of T
   is defined to be result subtype of the First function. The
   First function's name shall be resolvable from these rules alone.
   [This means the iteration cursor subtype of T can be determined
   without examining the other subprogram names].
   The iteration cursor subtype of T shall be definite and shall not be
   limited.

7. The Next function of the type shall have two parameters, the first
   of type T and the second of the cursor subtype of T; the result subtype
   of the function shall be the cursor subtype of T.

8. The Has_Element function of the type shall have two parameters, the first
   of type T and the second of the cursor subtype of T; the result subtype
   of the function shall be Boolean.

9. The Element function of the type, if one is specified, shall have two
   parameters, the first of type T and the second of the cursor subtype of T;
   the default element subtype of T is then defined to be the result subtype
   of the Element function.

10. Reverse container element iterators are not in |SPARK|.
    The loop parameter of a container element iterator is a constant object.

11. A container element iterator shall only occur as the
    loop_parameter_specification of a quantified_expression[, and not as
    the iteration_scheme of a loop statement].

.. todo: positional notation in an Iterable aspect spec ok?

.. centered:: **Dynamic Semantics**

12. Iteration associated with a generalized iterator or a container element
    iterator procedes as follows. An object of the iteration cursor subtype
    of T (hereafter called "the cursor") is created
    and is initialized to the result of calling First, passing in the given
    container object. Each iteration begins by calling Has_Element, passing
    in the container and the cursor. If False is returned, execution of the
    associated loop is completed. If True is returned then iteration
    continues and the loop parameter for the next iteration of the loop
    is either (in the case of a generalized iterator) the cursor or
    (in the case of a container element iterator) the result of calling the
    Element function, passing in the container and the cursor. At the end of
    the iteration, Next is called (passing in the container and the cursor)
    and the result is assigned to the cursor.

.. _loop_invariants:

Loop Invariants, Variants and Entry Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two loop-related pragmas, Loop_Invariant and Loop_Variant, and a loop-related
attribute, Loop_Entry are defined. The pragma Loop_Invariant is used to specify
the essential non-varying properties of a loop. Pragma Loop_Variant is intended
for use in ensuring termination. The Loop_Entry attribute is used to refer to
the value that an expression had upon entry to a given loop in much the same way
that the ``Old`` attribute in a subprogram postcondition can be used to refer to
the value an expression had upon entry to the subprogram.

.. centered:: **Syntax**

::

  loop_variant_parameters ::= loop_variant_item {, loop_variant_item}
  loop_variant_item       ::= change_direction => discrete_expression
  change_direction        ::= Increases | Decreases

where ``discrete_expression`` is an ``expression`` of a discrete type.

.. centered:: **Static Semantics**

.. _tu-pr-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-01:

1. Pragma Loop_Invariant is like a pragma Assert except it also acts
   as a *cut point* in formal verification. A cut point means that a prover is
   free to forget all information about modified variables that has been
   established within the loop. Only the given Boolean expression is carried
   forward.

.. _tu-pr-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-02:

2. Pragma Loop_Variant is used to demonstrate that a loop will terminate by
   specifying expressions that will increase or decrease as the loop is
   executed.

.. _etu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-ss:

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

.. _tu-cbatu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-03:

3. Loop_Invariant is an assertion just like pragma Assert with respect
   to syntax of its Boolean actual parameter, name resolution,
   legality rules and dynamic semantics, except for extra legality
   rules given below.

.. _tu-cbatu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-04:

4. Loop_Variant is an assertion and has an expected actual parameter
   which is a specialization of an Ada expression. Otherwise, it has
   the same name resolution and legality rules as pragma Assert,
   except for extra legality rules given below.

.. _tu-cbatu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-05:

5. The following constructs are said to be *restricted to loops*:

   * A Loop_Invariant pragma;

   * A Loop_Variant pragma;

   * A ``block_statement`` whose ``sequence_of_statements`` or
     ``declarative_part`` immediately includes a construct which is restricted
     to loops.

.. _tu-fe-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-06:

6. A construct which is restricted to loops shall occur immediately within
   either:

   * the ``sequence_of_statements`` of a ``loop_statement``; or

   * the ``sequence_of_statements`` or ``declarative_part`` of a
     ``block_statement``.

   The construct is said to apply to the innermost enclosing loop.

   [Roughly speaking, a Loop_Invariant or Loop_Variant pragma
   shall only occur immediately within a loop statement except that intervening
   block statements are ignored for purposes of this rule.]

.. _tu-fe-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-07:

7. The expression of a ``loop_variant_item`` shall be of any
   discrete type.

.. _tu-fe-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-08:

8. Two Loop_Invariant or Loop_Variant pragmas which apply to
   the same loop shall occur in the same ``sequence_of_statements``,
   separated only by [zero or more] other Loop_Invariant or
   Loop_Variant pragmas.

.. _etu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-lr:

.. centered:: **Dynamic Semantics**

.. _tu-cbatu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-09:

9. Other than the above legality rules, pragma Loop_Invariant is equivalent to
   pragma ``Assert``. Pragma Loop_Invariant is an assertion (as defined in Ada
   RM 11.4.2(1.1/3)) and is governed by the Loop_Invariant assertion aspect
   [and may be used in an Assertion_Policy pragma].

.. _tu-fe-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-10:

10. The elaboration of a Checked Loop_Variant pragma begins by evaluating the
    ``discrete_expressions`` in textual order. For the first elaboration of the
    pragma within a given execution of the enclosing loop statement, no further
    action is taken. For subsequent elaborations of the pragma, one or more of
    these expression results are each compared to their corresponding result from
    the previous iteration as follows: comparisons are performed in textual order
    either until unequal values are found or until values for all expressions
    have been compared. In either case, the last pair of values to be compared is
    then checked as follows: if the ``change_direction`` for the associated
    ``loop_variant_item`` is Increases (respectively, Decreases) then a check is
    performed that the expression value obtained during the current iteration is
    greater (respectively, less) than the value obtained during the preceding
    iteration. The exception Assertions.Assertion_Error is raised if this check
    fails. All comparisons and checks are performed using predefined operations.
    Pragma Loop_Variant is an assertion (as defined in Ada RM 11.4.2(1.1/3)) and
    is governed by the Loop_Variant assertion aspect [and may be used in an
    Assertion_Policy pragma].

.. _etu-loop_invariants_variants_and_entry_values-ds:

.. centered:: **Examples**

The following example illustrates some pragmas of this section

.. literalinclude:: ../../../testsuite/gnatprove/tests/RM_Examples/loop_var_loop_invar.adb
   :language: ada
   :linenos:

Note that in this example, the loop variant is unnecessarily complex,
stating that ``I`` increases is enough to prove termination of this
simple loop.

.. _loop_entry:

Attribute Loop_Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. centered:: **Static Semantics**

.. _tu-cbatu-attribute_loop_entry-01:

1. For a prefix *X* that denotes an object of a nonlimited type, the
   following attribute is defined:

   ::

      X'Loop_Entry [(loop_name)]

.. _tu-fe-attribute_loop_entry-02:

2. X'Loop_Entry [(loop_name)] denotes a constant object of the type of X.
   [The value of this constant is the value of X on entry to the loop that
   is denoted by ``loop_name`` or, if no ``loop_name`` is provided,
   on entry to the closest enclosing loop.]

.. _etu-attribute_loop_entry:

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

.. _tu-cbatu-attribute_loop_entry-03:

3. A Loop_Entry ``attribute_reference`` *applies to* a ``loop_statement`` in the
   same way that an ``exit_statement`` does (see Ada RM 5.7). For every rule
   about ``exit_statements`` in the Name Resolution Rules and Legality Rules
   sections of Ada RM 5.7, a corresponding rule applies to Loop_Entry
   ``attribute_references``.

.. _tu-cbatu-attribute_loop_entry-04:

4. In many cases, the language rules pertaining to the Loop_Entry
   attribute match those pertaining to the Old attribute (see Ada LRM 6.1.1),
   except with "Loop_Entry" substituted for "Old". These include:

   * prefix name resolution rules (including expected type definition)

   * nominal subtype definition

   * accessibility level definition

   * run-time tag-value determination (in the case where *X* is tagged)

   * interactions with abstract types

   * interactions with anonymous access types

   * forbidden attribute uses in the prefix of the ``attribute_reference``.

   The following rules are not included in the above list;
   corresponding rules are instead stated explicitly below:

   * the requirement that an Old ``attribute_reference`` shall only occur in a
     postcondition expression;

   * the rule disallowing a use of an entity declared within the
     postcondition expression;

   * the rule that a potentially unevaluated Old ``attribute_reference``
     shall statically denote an entity;

   * the prefix of the ``attribute_reference`` shall not contain a Loop_Entry
     ``attribute_reference.``

.. _tu-fe-attribute_loop_entry-05:

5. A ``Loop_Entry`` ``attribute_reference`` shall occur within a ``Loop_Variant``
   or ``Loop_Invariant`` pragma, or an ``Assert``, ``Assume`` or
   ``Assert_And_Cut`` pragma appearing in a position where a ``Loop_Invariant``
   pragma would be allowed.

   [Roughly speaking, a ``Loop_Entry`` ``attribute_reference`` can occur in an
   ``Assert``, ``Assume`` or ``Assert_And_Cut`` pragma immediately within a loop
   statement except that intervening block statements are ignored for purposes of
   this rule.]

.. _tu-fe-attribute_loop_entry-06:

6. The prefix of a Loop_Entry ``attribute_reference`` shall not contain a use
   of an entity declared within the ``loop_statement`` but not within the prefix
   itself.

   [This rule is to allow the use of I in the following example:

   .. code-block:: ada

     loop
        pragma Assert
          ((Var > Some_Function (Param => (for all I in T => F (I))))'Loop_Entry);

   In this example the value of the inequality ">" that would have been
   evaluated on entry to the loop is obtained even if the value of Var has since
   changed].

.. _tu-fe-attribute_loop_entry-07:

7. The prefix of a Loop_Entry ``attribute_reference`` shall statically denote
   an entity, or shall denote an ``object_renaming_declaration``, if

   * the ``attribute_reference`` is potentially unevaluated; or

   * the ``attribute_reference`` does not apply to the innermost
     enclosing ``loop_statement``.

.. _etu-attribute_loop_entry-lr:

   [This rule follows the corresponding Ada RM rule for 'Old.
   The prefix of an Old attribute_reference that is potentially unevaluated
   shall statically denote an entity and have the same rationale. If the
   following was allowed:

   .. code-block:: ada

      procedure P (X : in out String; Idx : Positive) is
      begin
         Outer :
            loop
               if Idx in X'Range then
                  loop
                     pragma Loop_Invariant (X(Idx) > X(Idx)'Loop_Entry(Outer));

   this would introduce an exception in the case where Idx is not in X'Range.]

.. centered:: **Dynamic Semantics**

.. _tu-cbatu-attribute_loop_entry-08:

8. For each X'Loop_Entry other than one occurring within an Ignored
   assertion expression, a constant is implicitly declared at the beginning of
   the associated loop statement. The constant is of the type of X and is
   initialized to the result of evaluating X (as an expression) at the point
   of the constant declaration. The value of X'Loop_Entry is the value of this
   constant; the type of X'Loop_Entry is the type of X. These implicit
   constant declarations occur in an arbitrary order.

.. _tu-cbatu-attribute_loop_entry-09:

9. The previous paragraph notwithstanding, the implicit constant declaration
   is not elaborated if the ``loop_statement`` has an ``iteration_scheme`` whose
   evaluation yields the result that the ``sequence_of_statements`` of the
   ``loop_statement`` will not be executed (loosely speaking, if the loop
   completes after zero iterations).

   [Note: This means that the constant is not elaborated unless the
   loop body will execute (or at least begin execution) at least once.
   For example, a while loop

   .. code-block:: ada

      while <condition> do
         sequence_of_statements; -- contains Loop_Entry uses
      end loop;

   may be thought of as being transformed into

   .. code-block:: ada

      if <condition> then
         declare
         ... implicitly declared Loop_Entry constants
         begin
            loop
               sequence_of_statements;
               exit when not <condition>;
            end loop;
         end;
      end if;

   The rule also prevents the following example from raising Constraint_Error:

   .. code-block:: ada

      declare
         procedure P (X : in out String) is
         begin
            for I in X'Range loop
               pragma Loop_Invariant (X(X'First)'Loop_Entry >= X(I));
               X := F(X); -- modify X
            end loop;
         end P;
         Length_Is_Zero : String := "";
      begin
         P (Length_Is_Zero);
     end; -- ...]

Proof Pragmas
-------------

This section discusses the pragmas Assert_And_Cut and Assume.

Two |SPARK| pragmas are defined, Assert_And_Cut and Assume. Each is an
assertion and has a single Boolean parameter (an assertion expression)
and may be used wherever pragma Assert is allowed.

Assert_And_Cut may be used within a subprogram when the given
expression sums up all the work done so far in the subprogram, so that
the rest of the subprogram can be verified (informally or formally)
using only the entry preconditions, and the expression in this
pragma. This allows dividing up a subprogram into sections for the
purposes of testing or formal verification. The pragma also serves as
useful documentation.

A Boolean expression which is an actual parameter of pragma Assume can
be assumed to be True for the remainder of the subprogram. If the
Assertion_Policy is Check for pragma Assume and the Boolean expression
does not evaluate to True, the exception Assertions.Assertion_Error
will be raised.  However, in proof, no verification of the expression
is performed and in general it cannot. It has to be used with caution
and is used to state axioms.

.. centered:: **Static Semantics**

.. _tu-pr-proof_pragmas-01:

1. Pragma Assert_And_Cut is an assertion the same as a pragma Assert
   except it also acts as a cut point in formal verification. The cut
   point means that a prover is free to forget all information about
   modified variables that has been established from the statement
   list before the cut point. Only the given Boolean expression is
   carried forward.

.. _tu-pr-proof_pragmas-02:

2. Pragma Assume is an assertion the same as a pragma Assert except
   that there is no verification condition to prove the truth of the Boolean
   expression that is its actual parameter. [Pragma Assume indicates
   to proof tools that the expression can be assumed to be True.]

.. _etu-proof_pragmas-ss:

.. centered:: **Legality Rules**

.. _tu-cbatu-proof_pragmas-03:

3. Pragmas Assert_And_Cut and Assume have the same syntax for their Boolean
   actual parameter, name resolution rules and dynamic semantics as pragma
   Assert.

.. _etu-proof_pragmas-lr:

.. _assertcutinv_proof_semantics:

.. centered:: **Verification Rules**

.. _tu-cbatu-proof_pragmas-04:

4. The verification rules for pragma Assume are significantly different to those
   of pragma Assert. [It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the
   difference.] Even though the dynamic semantics of pragma Assume and pragma
   Assert are identical, pragma Assume does not introduce a corresponding verification
   condition. Instead the prover is given permission to assume the truth of the
   assertion, even though this has not been proven. [A single incorrect Assume
   pragma can invalidate an arbitrarily large number of proofs - the
   responsibility for ensuring correctness rests entirely upon the user.]
