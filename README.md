1. Introduction
---------------

This repository contains the source code for the SPARK2014 project. SPARK is a
software development technology specifically designed for engineering
high-reliability applications. It consists of a programming language, a
verification toolset and a design method which, taken together, ensure that
ultra-low defect software can be deployed in application domains where
high-reliability must be assured, for example where safety and security are
key requirements.

2. Commercial support
---------------------

SPARK is a commercially supported by AdaCore and Altran, you can visit the
[AdaCore website](http://www.adacore.com) for more information.

3. GPL version
--------------

There is a GPL version of the tools, readily packaged, and suited for research
and hobbyist use. You can find it at [libre.adacore.com] (http://libre.adacore.com).


4. Documentation
----------------

You can find the definition of the SPARK language in the
[SPARK reference manual](http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/lrm/),
and instructions on how to use the tool, together with a tutorial, in the
[SPARK User's Guide](http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/ug/).
