# 1. Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the SPARK 2014 project. SPARK
is a software development technology specifically designed for engineering
high-reliability applications. It consists of a programming language,
a verification toolset and a design method which, taken together, ensure
that ultra-low defect software can be deployed in application domains where
high-reliability must be assured, for example where safety and security are
key requirements.

# 2. Commercial support

SPARK is commercially supported by AdaCore and Altran, you can visit the
[AdaCore website](http://www.adacore.com/sparkpro/) for more information.

# 3. GPL version

There is a GPL version of the tools, readily packaged, and suitable for
research and hobbyist use. You can download it from
[libre.adacore.com](http://libre.adacore.com/download/).

# 4. Community

News about SPARK project are shared primarily on [a dedicated
blog](http://www.spark-2014.org/). Discussions about SPARK occur on [a public
mailing-list](https://lists.forge.open-do.org/mailman/listinfo/spark2014-discuss).

# 5. Documentation

You can find the definition of the SPARK language in the
[SPARK Reference Manual](http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/lrm/),
and instructions on how to use the tool, together with a tutorial, in the
[SPARK User's Guide](http://docs.adacore.com/spark2014-docs/html/ug/).
