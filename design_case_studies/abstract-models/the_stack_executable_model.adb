-- In the body the functions are so simple that function expressions are used to
-- give both a refined post condition and an implementation.
-- A refined global contract is shown for the expression functions but is
-- perhaps a little pedantic. I am not sure if we should make them
-- mandatory, optionally present or never present for the constructive profile?
-- I think optionally present is probably the most flexible with stricter
-- rules applied using GNATCheck if required.
-- The same reasoning could be applied to ordinary subprogram bodies
-- as we know from their specification the state abstraction that is global
-- and from the state refinement contract we know which globals are
-- accessible.
-- The refined postconditions using 'Update (or for all ...) are computationally
-- expensive, whereas the abstract model is computationally very cheap.
-- Perhaps it would be worth having an aspect clause denoting that the refined
-- postcondition is not to be used in the final code or to be used for proof only?
-- Having proven or demonstrated that the bodies of the subprograms satisfy the
-- constraints of the refined postcondition, just the abstract model is used.
-- That way we have an efficient model which could be retained in running code.
-- The contracts are executable.
