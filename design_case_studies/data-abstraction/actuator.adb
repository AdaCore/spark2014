-- In the body of Actuator the state abstraction Actuator.State is refined in to
-- constituents, both of which are state abstractions of its private children.
-- The subprograms of Actuator are defined in terms of calls to subprograms of
-- its children which each work on part of the overall state abstraction
-- Actuator.State.
-- An interesting point is the Initial_Condition of Actuator which is given
-- in terms of its function Status.  The specification (and implementation) of
-- Status is actually a call of the function Mirror.Get_State.
-- The Initial_Condition of Actuator.Mirror.State is given in terms of
-- Actuator.Mirror.State.  We will need to be able to prove that
-- Actuator.Mirror.Get_State = Actuator.Unknown ->
--    Actuator.Status = Actuator.Uknown.
