AdaCore TCP/IP stack for high-integrity systems
===============================================

Copyright (C) 2010, AdaCore

SUPPORTED TARGETS
-----------------

This TCP/IP stack can be used either on a PowerPC bare-board system
or on a Linux host as a native process. In the latter case, the TAP
device is used for communication between the stack and the host system.

The PowerPC version can be run on a QEmu virtual system.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------

Building the TCP/IP Stack requires the GNAT Pro tool chain.

Building for PowerPC also requires the ZFP-Support package to be
installed and available to your cross build chain.

BUILD AND RUN INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

To build the native Linux version:
   make TARGET=native

To build the PowerPC bareboard version:
   make TARGET=powerpc-elf

This builds a complete example application that implements the TCP echo
service on well-known port 7.

In both cases, the resulting executable is build/app/echop.

To start the PowerPC version under qemu, you can use "make run".

SPARK
-----

To run SPARK examiner on the stack, use:
   make spark
