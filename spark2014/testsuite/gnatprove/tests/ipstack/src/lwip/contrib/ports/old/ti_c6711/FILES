This directory contains architecture and compiler specific stuff for porting lwIP
to the TI TMS320C6711 DSP. It's done on the official C6711 DSK board, in CCS v2.10.

The sequential API has not been ported; its functions are empties. If someone is
interested in adding a sequential API, please contact the author (see below).

The ethernet connection was based on an daughtercard design by the author.
Schematic files can be found as part of project "ucos-lwip-c6x" on SourceForge.net
The daughtercard is NE2000 compliant. And the driver supports interrupts.
