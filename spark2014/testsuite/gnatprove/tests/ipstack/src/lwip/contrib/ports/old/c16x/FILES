This directory contains architecture and compiler specific stuff for porting lwIP
to the C16x and ST10 microcontrollers. The compiler specifics are for Tasking EDE
v7.5r2.

The sequential API has not been ported; its functions are empties. If someone is
interested in adding a sequential API, please contact the author (see below).

Besides this, a Cirrus (formerly Crystal Semiconductors) CS8900a Ethernet driver
is included, which assumes a 16-bit data bus configuration. When porting this
driver, note that the CS8900a does not support interrupts in 8-bit mode.
