This directory is a mirror of the unixsim one, with pieces written in Ada. At
this stage, this is an experimental sandbox for incremental work on a binding
design, before we get to reimplement the core functions.

To run, 

  make

then

  ./adaservices

This arranges to call the former simhost main with no arguments
and has a number of apps/ service threads implemented in Ada.
