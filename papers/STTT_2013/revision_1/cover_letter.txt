Dear Reviewers,

We are very grateful for the many insightful and constructive comments on our
paper. Thank you.

The most important modifications to the paper that we have made are
the addition of related work in the introduction (Section 1), addition
of section 3.5 on related work in combined test and proof, as well as
general editing and rewording to provide a more balanced statement. We
have also added section 6.1 about how and when the solutions for the
VerifyThis challenges were produced and a small conclusion section.

We have not been able to address the requests for additional
evaluations against other industrial strength tools, as all our
resources are currently devoted to finishing SPARK 2014 and GNATprove.
We have provided a reference to one piece of early evaluation in the
conclusion section, and as both SPARK and GNAT are open source
software, it should be possible for others to perform further
evaluations in the future.

Many statements have been clarified with the help of specific review
comments.  see list of actions done for specific per review comments, attached.

Many thanks for your help,

the Authors
