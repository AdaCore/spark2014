  abstract = {Static analyzers usually return partial results. They can assert that some
  properties are valid during all possible executions of a program, but
  generally leave some other properties to be verified by other means. In
  practice, it is common to combine results from several methods manually to
  achieve the full verification of a program. In this context, Frama-C is a
  platform for analyzing C source programs with multiple analyzers. Hence, one
  analyzer might conclude about properties assumed by another one, in the same
  environment. We present here the semantical foundations of validity of program
  properties in such a context. We propose a correct and complete algorithm for
  combining several partial results into a fully consolidated validity status
  for each program property. We illustrate how such a framework provides
  meaningful feedback on partial results.}

abstract="Auto-active verifiers provide a level of automation intermediate between fully automatic and interactive: users supply code with annotations as input while benefiting from a high level of automation in the back-end. This paper presents AutoProof, a state-of-the-art auto-active verifier for object-oriented sequential programs with complex functional specifications. AutoProof fully supports advanced object-oriented features and a powerful methodology for framing and class invariants, which make it applicable in practice to idiomatic object-oriented patterns. The paper focuses on describing AutoProof 's interface, design, and implementation features, and demonstrates AutoProof 's performance on a rich collection of benchmark problems. The results attest AutoProof 's competitiveness among tools in its league on cutting-edge functional verification of object-oriented programs.",
