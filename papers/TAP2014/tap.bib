  abstract = {Static analyzers usually return partial results. They can assert that some
  properties are valid during all possible executions of a program, but
  generally leave some other properties to be verified by other means. In
  practice, it is common to combine results from several methods manually to
  achieve the full verification of a program. In this context, Frama-C is a
  platform for analyzing C source programs with multiple analyzers. Hence, one
  analyzer might conclude about properties assumed by another one, in the same
  environment. We present here the semantical foundations of validity of program
  properties in such a context. We propose a correct and complete algorithm for
  combining several partial results into a fully consolidated validity status
  for each program property. We illustrate how such a framework provides
  meaningful feedback on partial results.}
