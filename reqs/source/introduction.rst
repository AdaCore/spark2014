Introduction
============

Background
----------

|SPARK| is a programming language and a set of verification tools
designed to meet the needs of high-assurance software development.
|SPARK| is based on Ada 2012, both subsetting the language to remove
features that defy verification, but also extending the system of
contracts and "aspects" to support modular, formal verification.

|SPARK| is a much larger and more flexible language than its
predecessor SPARK 2005. The language can be configured to suit
a number of application domains and standards, from server-class
high-assurance systems (such as air-traffic management applications),
to embedded, hard real-time, critical systems (such as avionic
systems complying with DO-178C Level A).


Purpose
-------

This document describes the |SPARK| operational requirements and use cases.

Scope
-----

These requirements and use cases cover all expected uses of |SPARK| and as such affect the language definition, tools and their use to meet certification goals.
