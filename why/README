This file describes the installation process for Why and Alt-Ergo, both needed
for gnatprove to work.

At least Why must be compiled from source, so you need an ocaml installation,
to be downloaded from here:
   http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
and the ocamlgraph library.

Ocamlgraph
==========

This library is necessary to compile both Alt-Ergo and Why. It is simplest to
compile it from source. Download the source archive from
      http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr/
extract the source and do
      ./configure
      make
      make install

Alt-Ergo
========

The website of Alt-Ergo is
      http://alt-ergo.lri.fr/
You may either use the binary for your architecture, or compile Alt-Ergo
yourself, by downloading the source package and using the commands
      ./configure
      make
      make install

Flexdll (windows only)
=======

  This one is needed to compile why under Windows.

   1) Download the file
      http://alain.frisch.fr/flexdll/flexdll-bin-0.26.zip
   2)unzip flexdll-bin-0.26.zip in a flexdll/ directory (no need to compile that one, we
      use the existing binary)
   3) add it to the PATH


Why
===

Why needs to be compiled from source because we apply patches to the Why
source.  You need to download the Why source package from
      http://why.lri.fr/
After extracting the compressed archive, the following steps are necessary:

   0) (Windows) Make sure to have Flexdll installed in your PATH, see above

   1) Apply the patches in subdir patches/ that correspond to your version of
      Why, in the correct order:
       (in the extracted directory)
       patch -p0 < why-2.29-1.patch
       patch -p0 < why-2.29-2.patch
       ...
   2) Apply the usual steps
        ./configure
        make
        make install

   3) Set the environment variable WHYLIB to this value:
      export WHYLIB=`why --where`
