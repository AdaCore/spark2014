# Do not use cpp with -P switch to remove line directives generated by
# preprocessing, as this also removes blank lines that are needed by
# the Coq printer/parser in Why3 to recognize the VC. Use sed instead to
# remove lines that start with # symbol.
# Also cpp does not understand the sequence slash space end_of_line so we
# added a comment with the first sed. Basically cpp should not be used
# for this but we don't know what to use to replace it. This is a hack.
