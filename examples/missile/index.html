<h2><a name="disclaimer">
Disclaimer</a></h2>

<p>This project has no connection with my employer, or with anyone
else except where explicitly stated to the contrary in this documentation.
This software was developed on <em>my</em> time, on <em>my</em> PC, 
in <em>my</em> house, with
<em>my</em> purchased operating system and tools, and is provided on a website
which <em>I</em> pay to have hosted, under a domain which <em>I</em> own.  
</p>

<p>Read the <a href="gpl.txt">license</a> for details, but the general
theme is that if you use this software in any way at all that causes
your aircraft to catch fire, your missile to explode on the launch pad,
or your nuclear warhead to detonate in the silo, then my responsibility
ends with "Bummer."
</p>

<p>Clear? :-)</p>

<h2><a name="intro">
Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This is the home page for the Missile Guidance System simulator,
developed in SPARK Ada 95 as a demonstrator software system for
SPARK-related technologies.  All this software is released under
the <a href="gpl.txt">GNU General Public License;</a> you are
encouraged to read this license if you are not already familiar
with it so that you understand the terms under which this software
is distributed.
</p>

<p>The design and code for this simulator were developed by Adrian
Hilton as part of the work for his Ph.D. thesis.  They have been
made publically available to provide a common base of Ada code
for analysis, compilation and development of high-integrity systems.
The author welcomes <a href="mailto:sim@suslik.org">feedback</a> on
the software, including any patches or suggested improvements.
At some point in the future, I may put the whole thing up on
SourceForge, but I haven't done so yet.  
</p>

<h2><a name="tech">
Technical Details</a></h2>

<p>This software is written in the SPARK[<a href="#spark">1</a>] subset
of Ada.  It should compile and run with <em>any</em> valid Ada 95
compiler, although the compiler used by the author is GNAT from
<a href="http://www.gnat.com/">Ada Core Technologies</a> (on 
x86 Linux and Windows 2000).  
</p>

<p>The software has been analysed using the 
<a href="http://www.sparkada.com/">SPARK Examiner</a> version 7.0
and SPADE Simplifier from 
<a href="http://www.praxis-his.com/">Praxis High Integrity Systems.</a>
You don't need these tools to compile or run the system; however,
I recommend that if you're interested in developing or analysing
the system that you look getting them.  Size-limited versions of these
tools are available with the book
<a href="http://www.sparkada.com/book.html">High Integrity Software: The
SPARK Approach to Safety and Security</a> from Praxis High Integrity Systems,
and are adequate for analysing the simulator software.
For information on obtaining full versions of the tools, contact 
<a href="mailto:sparkinfo@praxis-his.com">Praxis HIS.</a>
</p>

<p>The software build, test and analysis process is controlled by
the file <kbd>Makefile</kbd> for the <kbd>make</kbd> program.
You can do it manually, but I like using <kbd>make.</kbd>
</p>

<p>The actual guidance software is embedded into a script-driven
test harness that allows you to feed control commands and test
checks via standard input, and displays check output on standard
output.  Some test scripts are included in the package, demonstrating
control and testing of system components.
</p>

<p>For more information on the system, see the
<a href="sys_desc.html">system description.</a>

<h2><a name="download">
Download</a></h2>

<p>Download the gzipped tar file
<a href="harness.tgz">here.</a>
</p>

<p>Once downloaded, type
<br/><kbd>tar xzf harness.tgz</kbd> to extract the files, or
<br/><kbd>mv harness.tgz harness.tar.gz</kbd>
<br/><kbd>gunzip harness.tar.gz</kbd>
<br/><kbd>tar xf harness.tar</kbd> if you have an old version of <kbd>tar</kbd> 
</p>

<p>Once extracted, type
<br/><kbd>make harness</kbd>
<br/>to build the harness, or
<br/><kbd>cd Code; gnatmake test_harness</kbd> if you don't have a working <kbd>make.</kbd>
