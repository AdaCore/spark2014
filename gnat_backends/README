To build Hi-Lite-specific GNAT backends from sources, you need to
create a link gnat_backends/gnat_src which points to the GNAT source
directory; then go the back end directory and run "make".  This will
create a directory structure under <backend name>/install.

You can then run each tool with the following command:

<tool> -I`gnatls -v | grep adainclude` <source file>

...exempli gratia:

gnat2spark -I`gnatls -v | grep adainclude` ./gnat_src/gnatmake.adb

Any backend-specific information should be found in the README file that
you may find in its directory. Two backends are provided:
- SPARK;
- Why.
