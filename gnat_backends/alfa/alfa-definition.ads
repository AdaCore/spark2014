-- Detection of Alfa entities --
--------------------------------

--  All entities from the program are marked as being in Alfa or not in Alfa,
--  so that the translation to Why3 processes adequately the entity depending
--  on its status.

--  All entities except Itypes are marked at the point where they are declared.
--  Forward references to an entity (such as a call to a subprogram in a
--  contract before this subprogram is declared) are not in Alfa. Itypes
--  (implicit types introduced by the frontend) and class-wide types are
--  treated differently, as they may not have an explicit declaration.
--  Therefore, Itypes and class-wide types are marked the first time they
--  are referenced.

--  Marking of an entity works as follows:
--    * A scope for the entity is pushed on a stack, and the definition of the
--      entity is marked. Any violation of Alfa during marking is recorded as
--      a violation for all entities on the stack. For example, the use of a
--      feature not in Alfa in the body of a local subprogram results in the
--      violation being attached to both subprograms.
--    * After marking, if no violation is attached to the entity, it is marked
--      as in Alfa. In any case, it is marked as being treated from now on, so
--      that future references are not counted as forward references.
--    * If the entity is defined in the spec or the body of the current
--      compiled unit, it is added to one of the list of entities Spec_Entities
--      or Body_Entities, which will be translated to Why3. The translation
--      will depend on the status (in Alfa or not) of each entity.

--  Subprogram specs and subprogram bodies are treated as two different scopes,
--  so that a subprogram spec can be in Alfa even if its body is not in Alfa.

--  Except for private types and deferred constants, a unique entity is used
--  for multiple views of the same entity. For example, the entity attached to
--  a subprogram body or a body stub is not used.

--  Private types are always in Alfa (except currently record (sub)type with
--  private part), even if the underlying type is not in Alfa. This allows
--  operations which do not depend on the underlying type to be in Alfa, which
--  is the case in client code that does not have access to the underlying
--  type. Since only the partial view of a private type is used in the AST
--  (except at the point of declaration of the full view), even when visibility
--  over the full view is needed, the nodes that need this full view are
--  treated specially, so that they are in Alfa only if the most underlying
--  type is in Alfa. This most underlying type is the last type obtained by
--  taking:
--  . for a private type, its underlying type
--  . for a record subtype, its base type
--  . for all other types, itself
--  until reaching a non-private type that is not a record subtype.

--  Partial views of deferred constants may be in Alfa even if their full view
--  is not in Alfa. This is the case if the type of the constant is in Alfa,
--  while its initializing expression is not.

   --  attached to a declaration or not (for Itypes).
