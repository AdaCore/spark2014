Chapter 3.5.3 defines Standard.Boolean as an enumeration type;
however, it is more natural to map it to type bool in Why. Still, in
some cases, it may be needed to have an "enum" view of this type in
order to use predefined operations on discrete types
(e.g. 'Range). For these cases, we can provide a special enum type
standard__boolean that we could convert into bool or int.
