This details how fixed points would be represented in Why.

For these types, the best representation would probably be an integer
representation; still, conversion functions to/from mathematical reals
could be provided. This is showed in fixed.why.

This example does not show the case of decimal fixed point types; the
computation of the bounds is different, but the generated code ends up
being quite similar.
