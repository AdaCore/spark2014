Example of illegal code:

```ada
   type Int_Access is access Integer;
   X : access Integer := new Integer'(12); --  error
   --  Attempt to borrow the result of an allocator; this should be a move

   function Allocate return Int_Access;
   Y : access Integer := Allocate; --  error
   --  Attempt to borrow the result of a call to an allocating function; this
   --  should be a move.

   function F (X : access Integer) return access Integer is
   begin
      return Allocate;  -- error
      --  Attempt to borrow the result of an allocator; this should be a move or
      --  F should return an operation on X (making F a traversal function).
   end F;
```

This error is issued on an operation that creates a borrower or an observer -
an assignment into an object of an anonymous access-to-object type, a
declaration of such an object, an actual parameter in a call when the associated
formal parameter has an anonymous access-to-object type, or a return statement
from a traversal function (i.e., a function whose return type is an anonymous
access-to-object type). It is issued when the source of the borrow or observe
- the assigned expression, the actual parameter, or the returned expression - is
not a part of a stand-alone object or a formal parameter.

If this message occurs on an object declaration or a call, a possible fix is to
store the value of the source of the borrow or observe in a local object of a
named access type, and possibly borrow it afterward if necessary:

```ada
   V : Int_Access := new Integer'(12);  -- Move the result of the allocator to V
   X : access Integer := V;  -- Borrow V if necessary
   W : Int_Access := Allocate;  -- Move the result of Allocate to W
   Y : access Integer := W;  -- Borrow W if necessary
```

Return values of traversal functions and assignments into objects of an
anonymous access type are called *reborrows* and are restricted even further.
The source of the borrow or observe should be a part of the target for an
assignment and a part of the first parameter for the result of a traversal
function. There is no systematic way to fix the problem in this case.

Remember: SPARK associates ownership-related semantics (move, observe, borrow)
during assignments based on the kind of Ada access type that is the assignment
target. For more information, consult Section 5.9 of the SPARK Userâ€™s Guide.
