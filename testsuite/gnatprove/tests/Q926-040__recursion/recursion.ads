   -- is bounded above by Natural (note that an array with a Natural range need
   -- not have a Natural length).

   -- Count the number of true items in an array recursively. The postcondition
   -- given does not directly express the count, but merely states that the
   -- count is bounded above by index - first + 1, which is the number of items
   -- examined thus far.
