counterex.adb:7:14: warning: subprogram "Check" has no effect
counterex.adb:9:22: high: assertion might fail (e.g. when Tab = (1 => (A => -1, B => 0), others => (A => 0, B => 0))) [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at line 7 should mention Tab] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
counterexample expected for check at counterex.adb:9
