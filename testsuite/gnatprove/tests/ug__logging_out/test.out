    6 |      Total := Total + Incr;
      |               ~~~~~~^~~~~~
  e.g. when Incr = -1
        and Total = Integer'First
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
  possible fix: subprogram at logging_out.ads:7 should mention Incr and Total in a precondition
