prover_crash.adb:8:61: high: type is unsuitable as a target for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: floating-point types have invalid bit patterns for SPARK; invalid values could result from the unchecked conversion [SPARK RM 13.9]]

prover_crash.adb:11:42: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + Y [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: add precondition (X <= Myint'Last - Y) to subprogram at prover_crash.ads:11] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
