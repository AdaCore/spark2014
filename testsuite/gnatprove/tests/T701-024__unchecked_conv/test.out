prover_crash.adb:8:16: info: types in unchecked conversion have the same size (Trivial)
prover_crash.adb:8:54: info: type is suitable as source for unchecked conversion (Trivial)
prover_crash.adb:8:61: high: type is unsuitable as a target for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: floating-point types have invalid bit patterns for SPARK]
prover_crash.adb:11:27: info: range check proved (CVC4: 2 VC)
prover_crash.adb:11:42: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + Y (e.g. when X = Myint'Last and Y = 1) [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: subprogram at prover_crash.ads:11 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
