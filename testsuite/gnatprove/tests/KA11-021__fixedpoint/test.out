pack.adb:7:27: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Pocket + S (e.g. when Pocket = 999999999999999/100 and S = 1/100) [reason for check: result of fixed-point addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at pack.ads:16 should mention Pocket]
