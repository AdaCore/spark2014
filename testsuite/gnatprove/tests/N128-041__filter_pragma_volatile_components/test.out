foo.adb:16:25: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Total + Item (e.g. when Item = Integer'First and Total = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: loop at line 14 should mention Item and Total in a loop invariant]
