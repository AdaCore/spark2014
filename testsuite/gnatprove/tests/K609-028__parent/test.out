ext_pack.adb:9:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for C + Step (e.g. when C = -1 and Step = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at ext_pack.ads:8 should mention C and Step in a precondition]
