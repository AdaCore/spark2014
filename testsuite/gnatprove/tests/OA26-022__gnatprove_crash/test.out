eg.adb:3:04: warning: analyzing unreferenced function "Foo" [unreferenced-function]
eg.adb:3:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Foo" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
eg.adb:5:16: high: float overflow check might fail (e.g. when A = 2.7222588E+38 and B = -5.0781757E+9) [reason for check: result of floating-point multiplication must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
