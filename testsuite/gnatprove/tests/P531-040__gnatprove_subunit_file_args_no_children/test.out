pack-proc.adb:6:31: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for I + 1 (e.g. when I = Idx_T'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in component type] [possible fix: add precondition (I <= Idx_T'Last - 1) to subprogram at pack.adb:10] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
pack.adb:10:51: info: initialization of "Nf" proved
pack.adb:13:11: info: data dependencies proved
pack.ads:27:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Foo" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
