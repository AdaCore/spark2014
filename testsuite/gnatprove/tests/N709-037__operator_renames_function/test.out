main.adb:4:16: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove A = B (e.g. when A = (X => 0) and B = (X => 0))
main.adb:7:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when A = (X => -1) and B = (X => Integer'First)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
main.adb:7:23: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
