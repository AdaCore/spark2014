main.adb:4:16: medium: postcondition might fail (e.g. when A = (X => 0) and B = (X => 0)) [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Equivalent or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
main.adb:7:16: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for A.X + B.X (e.g. when A = (X => Integer'First) and B = (X => -1)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
main.adb:7:23: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
