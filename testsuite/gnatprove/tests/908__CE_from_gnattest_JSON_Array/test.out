simple.adb:9:23: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Toto + A (Elt) (e.g. when A = (0 => 5, 1 => 4, 2 => 5, 3 => 10, 4 => 10, 5 => 10, 6 => 5, 7 => 2, 8 => 1, 9 => 10, ...) and Elt = 2 and Toto = 9) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: subprogram at simple.ads:11 should mention A in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
