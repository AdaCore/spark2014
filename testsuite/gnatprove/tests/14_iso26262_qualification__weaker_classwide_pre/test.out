distributed_file_system.ads:26:20: medium: class-wide precondition might be stronger than overridden one, cannot prove F.Is_Synchronized [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Is_Open and function Is_Synchronized or turning them into expression functions in their unit spec]
