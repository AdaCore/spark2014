bad_lsp.ads:10:46: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X.F + X.G (e.g. when X = (F => Natural'Last, G => 1)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: enclosing 'Old attribute reference is unconditionally evaluated on subprogram entry]
