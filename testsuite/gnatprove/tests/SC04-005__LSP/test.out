bad_lsp.ads:10:46: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X.F + X.G [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: enclosing 'Old attribute reference is unconditionally evaluated on subprogram entry] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit Ada.Numerics.Big_Numerics.Big_Integers]
