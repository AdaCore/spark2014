pkg.adb:8:04: info: justified that "Descriptors" constituent of "State" is not initialized in "Pkg"
pkg.adb:8:04: warning: address specification on "Descriptors" is imprecisely supported: assuming no concurrent accesses to non-atomic object and no writes to or through a potential alias [E0012]
pkg.adb:8:04: warning: consider making "Descriptors" volatile and annotating it with Async_Writers and make sure that all overlapping objects have Async_Writers set to True

max steps used for successful proof: 0

Analyzed 1 unit
in unit pkg, 2 subprograms and packages out of 2 analyzed
  Pkg at pkg.ads:1 flow analyzed (0 errors, 0 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
   Justified check messages:
    pkg.adb:8:4: justified that "Descriptors" constituent of "State" is not initialized in "Pkg" (marked as: intentional, reason: "Suppressing main message should suppress cont line, too")
  Pkg.Foo at pkg.ads:7 flow analyzed (0 errors, 0 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
effects on parameters and Global variables of Pkg.Foo fully established
