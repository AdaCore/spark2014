Analyzed 2 units
in unit pkg, 2 subprograms and packages out of 2 analyzed
  Pkg at pkg.ads:1 flow analyzed (0 errors, 1 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
   Justified check messages:
    pkg.adb:8:4: justified that "Descriptors" constituent of "State" is not initialized in "Pkg" (marked as: intentional, reason: "Suppressing main message should suppress cont line, too")
  Pkg.Foo at pkg.ads:7 flow analyzed (0 errors, 0 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
effects on parameters and Global variables of Pkg.Foo fully established

  Pkg2 at pkg2.ads:1 flow analyzed (0 errors, 1 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
   Justified check messages:
    pkg2.adb:8:4: justified that initialization of "Pkg2.State" is specified at pkg2.ads:5 (marked as: intentional, reason: "Only suppressing continuation line")
