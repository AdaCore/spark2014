Analyzed 2 units
in unit pkg, 2 subprograms and packages out of 2 analyzed
  Pkg at pkg.ads:1 flow analyzed (0 errors, 0 checks, 0 warnings and 0 pragma Assume statements) and proved (0 checks)
   Justified check messages:
    pkg.adb:8:4: justified that "Descriptors" constituent of "State" is not initialized in "Pkg" (marked as: intentional, reason: "Suppressing main message should suppress cont line, too")
