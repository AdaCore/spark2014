exprfun.ads:3:55: medium: divide by zero might fail [possible explanation: subprogram at line 3 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
exprfun.ads:3:55: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = -1 and Y = 0) [reason for check: result of division must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 3 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
exprfun.ads:5:14: warning: subprogram "P" has no effect
