exprfun.ads:3:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Div" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
exprfun.ads:3:55: high: divide by zero might fail (e.g. when Y = 0) [possible fix: add precondition (Y /= 0) to subprogram at line 3] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
exprfun.ads:3:55: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X / Y [reason for check: result of division must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (X / Y >= Integer'First) to subprogram at line 3] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
exprfun.ads:5:14: warning: subprogram "P" has no effect
