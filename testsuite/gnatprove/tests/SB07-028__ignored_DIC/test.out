tokens_2.ads:15:09: medium: default initial condition might fail
tokens_2.ads:16:56: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for T_Length (Token_Set) + C [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]

tokens_2.ads:17:13: info: implicit terminating annotation on "T_Length" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
tokens_2.ads:19:13: info: implicit terminating annotation on "Init" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
tokens_2.ads:26:04: info: initialization of "X" proved
tokens_2.ads:29:18: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Length (X) + C (e.g. when C = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 19 should mention C and X in a precondition]
