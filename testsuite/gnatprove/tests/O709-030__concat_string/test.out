concat_string.adb:1:10: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Concat_String" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
concat_string.adb:4:21: low: range check might fail (e.g. when S = ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ..." and S'First = 1 and S'Last = Positive'Last) [reason for check: default component value must fit in the type] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention S in a precondition] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
concat_string.adb:5:31: info: range check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
concat_string.adb:5:40: warning: references to the "Image" attribute are handled in an imprecise way, so nothing will be known about the evaluation of the attribute reference apart from a bound on its length [imprecise-image]
concat_string.adb:7:14: low: range check might fail (e.g. when S1 = "v;" and S1'First = Positive'Last-1 and S2 = "value is  32" and S2'First = 1) [reason for check: returned value must fit in the result type of the function] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
