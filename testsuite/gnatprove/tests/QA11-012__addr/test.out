addr.adb:6:10: high: alignment of overlaying object might not be an integral multiple of alignment of overlaid object [possible explanation: unknown alignment for object] [possible fix: overlaying object should have an Alignment representation clause]

addr.adb:6:10: info: object is suitable for aliasing via address clause (Trivial)

addr.adb:6:50: info: types of aliased objects have the same size (Trivial)
addr.adb:8:33: medium: range check might fail (e.g. when Val = 'NUL') [reason for check: value cannot be minimum value of the type]
