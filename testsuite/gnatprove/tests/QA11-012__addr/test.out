addr.adb:6:10: high: address in address clause might not be an integral multiple of alignment of object [possible explanation: unknown alignment for object] [possible fix: overlaying object should have an Alignment representation clause]
addr.adb:6:10: high: object with non-trivial address clause or prefix of the 'Address reference does not have asynchronous writers
