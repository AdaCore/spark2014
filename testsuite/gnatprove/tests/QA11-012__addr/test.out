addr.adb:4:23: info: unrolling loop [info-unrolling-inlining]
addr.adb:6:10: high: address in address clause might not be an integral multiple of alignment of object [possible explanation: unknown alignment for object] [possible fix: overlaying object should have an Alignment representation clause]
addr.adb:6:10: high: object is unsuitable for aliasing via address clause [possible explanation: type Character has 256 values but has Object_Size 40, which allows 16#1000_0000_000# possible values; aliased object could have invalid values [SPARK RM 13.7]]
addr.adb:6:10: high: object with non-trivial address clause or prefix of the 'Address reference does not have asynchronous writers
addr.adb:6:50: info: object is suitable for aliasing via address clause (Trivial)
addr.adb:6:50: info: types of aliased objects have the same size (Trivial)
addr.adb:6:56: warning: alignment of object is not precisely known [imprecise-align]
addr.adb:8:33: medium: range check might fail [reason for check: value cannot be minimum value of the type]
