old_val.adb:6:14: warning: subprogram "Local" has no effect
old_val.adb:7:25: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X - Y (e.g. when X = 1 and Y = 2) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in the type of the qualification] [possible fix: add precondition (X >= Natural'First + Y) to subprogram at line 6]
