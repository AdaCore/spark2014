exprfun.ads:8:29: high: postcondition might fail (e.g. when A = True and B = False) [provers gave up before completing the proof]
typred.adb:5:08: medium: in inlined predicate at typred.ads:8
typred.adb:5:08: medium: predicate check might fail, cannot prove S.A (e.g. when X = (A => True, B => True)) [possible fix: subprogram at typred.ads:10 should mention X in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
