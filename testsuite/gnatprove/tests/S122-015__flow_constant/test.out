const.ads:5:39: medium: constant without variable input "C" cannot appear in Initializes
const.ads:7:33: info: precondition proved (Trivial: 1 VC)
other.adb:2:49: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for V + C [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at other.ads:8 should mention V]
other.ads:2:08: info: flow dependencies proved
