terminating_annotations.adb:8:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F_Rec" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "F_Rec" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
terminating_annotations.adb:8:26: info: range check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
terminating_annotations.adb:15:19: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F_While" could be incorrect, loop might be nonterminating [possible fix: add loop variant in the loop body]
terminating_annotations.adb:16:17: info: range check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
terminating_annotations.adb:37:07: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F_Call" could be incorrect, call to "Not_SPARK" might be nonterminating [possible fix: annotate "Not_SPARK" with aspect Always_Terminates]

terminating_annotations.ads:3:13: info: implicit function contract might not be available on recursive calls
terminating_annotations.ads:12:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F_Term" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
