repro.adb:5:30: info: loop invariant initialization proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
repro.adb:5:30: medium: loop invariant might not be preserved by an arbitrary iteration (e.g. when I = 43)
repro.adb:6:14: info: overflow check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
counterexample expected for check at repro.adb:5
  trace at repro.adb:4 --> I = 0
  trace at repro.adb:5 --> I = 43
[PREVIOUS]  trace at repro.adb:5 --> I = 43
