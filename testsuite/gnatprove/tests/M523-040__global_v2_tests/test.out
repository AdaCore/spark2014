main.adb:3:17: info: initialization of "Sum" proved
misc.adb:17:22: medium: assertion might fail, cannot prove G2 [possible explanation: subprogram at misc.ads:5 should mention G2 in a precondition]
p.adb:21:19: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when GN = -1073741826) [reason for check: result of multiplication must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 9 should mention GN in a precondition]
p.adb:21:25: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when GN = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 9 should mention GN in a precondition]
p.adb:21:30: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when GN = -1073741825) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 9 should mention GN in a precondition]
p.adb:33:22: medium: assertion might fail, cannot prove G = Nest(Nest.foo) (e.g. when G = 0 and GN = Integer'First) [possible explanation: subprogram at p.ads:4 should mention G and GN in a precondition]
p.adb:34:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = -1 and Y = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at p.ads:4 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
