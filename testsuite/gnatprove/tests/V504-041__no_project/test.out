      + possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit SPARK.Big_Integers
      + provers gave up before completing the proof
      + reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer

    3 |          Pragma Precondition (Integer'First <= X + Y and then X + Y <= Integer'Last);
 medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + Y
