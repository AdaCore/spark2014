spin_main.adb:12:30: medium: loop invariant might fail in first iteration, cannot prove sPIN.State_Invariant (State) [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function State_Invariant or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
spin_main.adb:12:30: medium: loop invariant might not be preserved by an arbitrary iteration, cannot prove sPIN.State_Invariant (State) [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function State_Invariant or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
