foo.adb:10:12: high: divide by zero might fail, in instantiation at foo.adb:19 (e.g. when B = 0) [possible fix: subprogram at line 5 should mention A and B in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
foo.adb:10:12: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for A / B, in instantiation at foo.adb:19 [reason for check: result of division must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 5 should mention A and B in a precondition] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
