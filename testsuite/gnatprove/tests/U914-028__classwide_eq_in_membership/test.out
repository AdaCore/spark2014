repr.adb:7:16: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on overriding operator "=" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
repr.adb:9:12: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F" could be incorrect, indirect dispatching call to record equality might be nonterminating [possible explanation: call could hide recursive calls]
repr.adb:21:19: medium: assertion might fail [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
