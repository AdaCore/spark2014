refined_depends_illegal.adb:20:14: useless refinement, declaration of subprogram "No_Depends_Contract" lacks aspect or pragma Depends
refined_depends_illegal.adb:35:14: aspect "Refined_Depends" must apply to the body of subprogram declared in a package specification
refined_depends_illegal.adb:53:14: global "X" is missing from output dependence list
refined_depends_illegal.adb:63:14: add "null => Var2" dependency to ignore this input
refined_depends_illegal.adb:63:14: global "Var" is missing from output dependence list
refined_depends_illegal.adb:63:14: global "Var2" is missing from input dependence list
refined_depends_illegal.adb:71:14: constituent "Z" is missing in output list
refined_depends_illegal.adb:71:14: output state "State2" must be replaced by all its constituents in dependence refinement
refined_depends_illegal.adb:81:48: duplicate use of item "W"
