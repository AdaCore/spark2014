This program is a standard example of controller, turning on and off the
heating depending on the value of the current temperature read by a thermostat
and the current mode of operation. Interfaces to the physical world are
modelled as External State Abstraction for sensors and actuators. Data and flow
dependency contracts are given for all subprograms. GNATprove proves all checks
on this program.
