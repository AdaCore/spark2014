p.ads:10:12: info: implicit function contract might not be available on recursive calls
p.ads:11:10: medium: implicit terminating annotation on "Sum" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive
p.ads:12:31: high: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Hi - 1 (e.g. when Hi = 0) [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: add precondition (Hi >= Index'First + 1) to subprogram at line 10]
p.ads:12:36: info: overflow check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
p.ads:12:41: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: add precondition (Hi in Index) to subprogram at line 10]
