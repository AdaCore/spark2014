p.ads:10:12: warning: "Sum" is recursive; its implicit contract might not be available on recursive calls from contracts and assertions [contracts-recursive]
p.ads:11:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Sum" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "Sum" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
p.ads:12:31: high: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Hi - 1 (e.g. when Hi = 0) [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: add precondition (Hi >= Index'First + 1) to subprogram at line 10] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
p.ads:12:36: info: overflow check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
p.ads:12:41: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: add precondition (Hi in Index) to subprogram at line 10] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
