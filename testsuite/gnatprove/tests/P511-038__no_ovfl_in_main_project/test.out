raised CONSTRAINT_ERROR : sub.adb:2 overflow check failed
sub.adb:2:13: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + Y (e.g. when X = Integer'First and Y = -1) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]
sub.adb:2:17: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + Y - 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'First and Y = 0) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]
sub.adb:3:11: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove X = Integer'last (e.g. when X = 1)
