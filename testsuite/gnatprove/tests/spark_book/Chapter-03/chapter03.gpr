   --  Exclude "pack" files from analysis, as this code is meant to show how
   --  elaboration problems are detected by GNAT compiler (here the binder). As
   --  a result, this is not valid SPARK code, and GNATprove requires
   --  Elaboration_All to be applied, which results in circular elaboration
   --  that is detected by both GNAT and GNATprove.
   --
   --  Also exclude "ohms_law.adb" which uses multiplication between two
   --  different fixed-point types, which is not currently supported in
   --  GNATprove.
   --
   --  Also exclude bingo_basket.adb from analysis, as it instantiates
   --  non-SPARK generic Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random in SPARK code.
   --
   --  Also exclude bingo_basket.ads, bingo_basket_test.adb and
   --  bingo_numbers.ads from analysis, as they are also in Chapter-08, so that
   --  we can build a project that includes all chapter projects.
