This collection of examples comes from the book "Building High Integrity
Applications with SPARK" written by Prof. John McCormick from University of
Northern Iowa and Prof. Peter Chapin from Vermont Technical College, published
by Cambridge University Press.

The examples follow the chapters of the book:

1. Introduction and overview
2. The basic SPARK language
3. Programming in the large
4. Dependency contracts
5. Mathematical background
6. Proof
7. Interfacing with SPARK
8. Software engineering with SPARK
9. Advanced techniques

Opening the example in GNAT Studio or GNATbench opens a project with all
sources. Projects corresponding to individual chapters are available in
subdirectories and can be opened manually.

The original source code is available from the [publisher's
website](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/building-high-integrity-applications-spark)
