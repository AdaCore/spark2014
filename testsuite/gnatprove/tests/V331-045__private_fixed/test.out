real_time.adb:9:38: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Time_Span'(F) [reason for check: value must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function F or turning it into an expression function]
real_time.ads:6:13: info: implicit function contract might not be available on calls from enclosing unit
