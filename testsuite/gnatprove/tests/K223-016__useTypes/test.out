iandatypes.adb:6:37: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Integer(X) + Integer (Y) (e.g. when X = 10 and Y = 1) [reason for check: result of addition must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: subprogram at iandatypes.ads:5 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
