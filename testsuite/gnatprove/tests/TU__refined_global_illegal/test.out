refined_global_illegal.adb:6:14: useless refinement, subprogram "P1" does not depend on abstract state with visible refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:20:14: useless refinement, declaration of subprogram "No_Global_Contract" lacks aspect or pragma Global
refined_global_illegal.adb:36:14: aspect "Refined_Global" must apply to the body of subprogram declared in a package specification
refined_global_illegal.adb:52:43: cannot mention state "State" in global refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:52:43: use its constituents instead
refined_global_illegal.adb:60:47: extra global item "Y" does not refine or repeat any global item at refined_global_illegal.ads:87
refined_global_illegal.adb:68:47: duplicate global item
refined_global_illegal.adb:76:14: global refinement of state "State" must include at least one constituent of mode "In_Out", "Input", or "Proof_In"
refined_global_illegal.adb:84:14: global refinement of state "State" redefines the mode of its constituents
refined_global_illegal.adb:92:14: "Output" state "State2" must be replaced by all its constituents in global refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:92:14: constituent "Z" is missing in output list
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:12:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = 0 and Y = -2147483649) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at refined_global_illegal_2.ads:6 should mention X in a precondition]
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:12:18: high: "Y" constituent of "State" must be listed in the Refined_Global aspect of "P1" (SPARK RM 6.1.4(14))
