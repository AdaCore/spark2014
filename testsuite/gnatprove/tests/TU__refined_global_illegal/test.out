refined_global_illegal.adb:6:14: useless refinement, subprogram "P1" does not depend on abstract state with visible refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:20:14: useless refinement, declaration of subprogram "No_Global_Contract" lacks aspect or pragma Global
refined_global_illegal.adb:36:14: aspect "Refined_Global" must apply to the body of subprogram declared in a package specification
refined_global_illegal.adb:52:43: cannot mention state "State" in global refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:52:43: use its constituents instead
refined_global_illegal.adb:60:47: extra global item "Y"
refined_global_illegal.adb:68:47: duplicate global item
refined_global_illegal.adb:76:14: global refinement of state "State" must include at least one constituent of mode "In_Out", "Input", or "Proof_In"
refined_global_illegal.adb:84:14: global refinement of state "State" redefines the mode of its constituents
refined_global_illegal.adb:92:14: "Output" state "State2" must be replaced by all its constituents in global refinement
refined_global_illegal.adb:92:14: constituent "Z" is missing in output list
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:5:04: info: initialization of "X" constituent of "State" proved
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:5:07: info: initialization of "Y" constituent of "State" proved
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:12:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = 0 and Y = -2147483649)
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:12:18: high: "Y" constituent of "State" must be listed in the Refined_Global aspect of "P1" (SPARK RM 6.1.4(13))
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:20:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when Par = 0 and X = 0 and Y = -2147483649)
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:20:18: high: "Y" constituent of "State" must be listed in the Refined_Global aspect of "P2" (SPARK RM 6.1.4(13))
refined_global_illegal_2.adb:21:16: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = 2147483647)
