This folder contains the complete source code of the small examples used in the
`Intro to SPARK` course available from the [AdaCore
Learn](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/index.html) website.
They include unannotated units, examples with formally verified data flow,
functional, or abstraction contracts, as well as erroneous programs, on which
GNATprove detects failing checks.

Opening the example in GNAT Studio or GNATbench opens an aggregate project, with
separate sub-projects for each lecture.
