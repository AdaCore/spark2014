foo.ads:12:13: high: alignment of source type of unchecked conversion might not be an integral multiple of alignment of target type [possible explanation: alignment of Byte_Array_4 (which is 1) must be a multiple of the alignment of Integer_32 (which is 4)]
foo.ads:12:13: info: types in unchecked conversion have the same size (Trivial)
foo.ads:13:42: info: type is suitable as source for unchecked conversion (Trivial)
foo.ads:14:42: info: type is suitable for unchecked conversion (Trivial)
foo.ads:16:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "toInteger_32" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
foo.ads:17:53: info: length check proved (CVC5: 3 VC)
main.adb:8:14: info: add a contract to analyze it separately from calling contexts
main.adb:8:14: info: local subprogram "bar" only analyzed in the context of calls [info-unrolling-inlining]
main.adb:8:19: info: initialization of "d" proved
main.adb:17:04: info: analyzing call to "bar" in context
main.adb:18:14: high: precondition might fail (e.g. when arr = (others => 0)) [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
main.adb:18:29: info: range check proved (CVC5: 4 VC)
