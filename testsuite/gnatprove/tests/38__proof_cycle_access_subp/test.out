main.adb:2:04: info: function contract feasibility proved (Trivial: 1 VC)
main.adb:4:13: info: function contract might not be available on implicit recursive calls
main.adb:4:43: medium: postcondition might fail
main.adb:5:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
main.adb:12:07: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F" could be incorrect, call via access-to-subprogram might be nonterminating [possible explanation: call could hide recursive calls]
main.adb:12:16: info: pointer dereference check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
