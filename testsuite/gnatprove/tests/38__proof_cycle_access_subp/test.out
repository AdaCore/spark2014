main.adb:2:04: info: function contract feasibility proved (Trivial: 1 VC)
main.adb:4:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
main.adb:4:13: warning: function contract might not be available on implicit recursive calls [contracts-recursive]
main.adb:4:43: medium: postcondition might fail
main.adb:5:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
main.adb:10:16: medium: call via access-to-function might not terminate [reason for check: functions should always terminate in SPARK] [possible explanation: calls via access-to-subprograms inside function taken as access might hide recursive calls]
main.adb:12:16: info: pointer dereference check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
