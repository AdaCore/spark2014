stacks_14-monitored_14.adb:19:25: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: call at line 18 should mention S (for argument S) in a postcondition]
stacks_14-monitored_14.adb:20:54: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for S.Next_Identity_Value + 1 [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: call at line 18 should mention S (for argument S) in a postcondition]
stacks_14-monitored_14.adb:25:30: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: add precondition (S.Stack_Pointer in Index_Range) to subprogram at stacks_14-monitored_14.ads:15]
