better_error_locations.adb:4:27: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for A.Return_State + B(B.return_state) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at better_error_locations.ads:4 should mention A.State and B.State in a precondition]
