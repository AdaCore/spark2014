 high: possible data race when accessing variable "account1.num_accounts"
--> bank1.ads:5:04
    5 |       Special_Accounts : Account_Management;
      |       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      + task "bank1.special_accounts" accesses "account1.num_accounts"
      + task "bank1.all_accounts" accesses "account1.num_accounts"
 medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Num_Accounts + 1
--> account1.adb:15:39
   15 |             Num_Accounts := Num_Accounts + 1;
      |                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
      + reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
      + possible fix: loop at line 13 should mention Num_Accounts in a loop invariant
