    5 |   Special_Accounts : Account_Management;
      |   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  task "bank1.special_accounts" accesses "account1.num_accounts"
  task "bank1.all_accounts" accesses "account1.num_accounts"

account1.adb:15:39: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Num_Accounts + 1
   15 |         Num_Accounts := Num_Accounts + 1;
      |                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
  e.g. when Num_Accounts = Natural'Last
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
  possible fix: loop at line 13 should mention Num_Accounts in a loop invariant
