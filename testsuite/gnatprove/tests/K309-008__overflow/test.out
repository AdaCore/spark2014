over.adb:4:07: info: initialization of "Res" proved
over.adb:7:20: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for (X + Y) (e.g. when X = 77 and Y = 51) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 8-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (X <= 127 - Y) to subprogram at over.ads:4] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
over.adb:7:25: info: range check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
over.ads:4:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "F" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
