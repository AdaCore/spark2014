vol.adb:6:03: high: object with constraints on bit representation is unsuitable for aliasing via address clause [possible explanation: type TaT4b doesn't have an Object_Size representation clause or aspect]
vol.adb:6:03: medium: alignment of overlaying object might not be an integral multiple of alignment of overlaid object [possible explanation: overlaying object should have an Alignment representation clause]
vol.adb:8:21: high: object with constraints on bit representation is unsuitable for aliasing via address clause [possible explanation: type TbT1b doesn't have an Object_Size representation clause or aspect]
vol.adb:8:21: high: types of aliased objects do not have the same size
vol.adb:14:07: medium: array index check might fail [possible explanation: subprogram at vol.ads:4 should mention idx in a precondition]
