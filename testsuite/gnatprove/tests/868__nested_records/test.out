p.adb:35:25: medium: discriminant check might fail (e.g. when V2_T1 = (D1 => True, D2 => True, F => 2222)) [possible fix: add or complete related loop invariants or postconditions]

p.adb:37:39: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V2_Int (e.g. when V2_Int = 15) [reason for check: value must fit in component type]
