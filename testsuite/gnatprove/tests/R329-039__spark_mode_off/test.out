inst.adb:6:19: medium: assertion might fail [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Get or turning it into an expression function]
p.adb:17:11: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: call at line 16 should mention X (for argument X) in a postcondition]
