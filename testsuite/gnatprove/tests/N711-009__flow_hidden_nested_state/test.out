p.adb:19:42: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for GN + Pr_Var [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 9 should mention GN and Pr_Var in a precondition]

p.adb:25:16: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + Y [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (if Y >= 0 then X <= Integer'Last - Y else X >= Integer'First - Y) to subprogram at p.ads:4]
