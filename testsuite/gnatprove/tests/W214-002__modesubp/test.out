nested.ads:3:14: warning: subprogram "P" has no effect
pack.adb:6:12: high: "Z" must be listed in the Global aspect of "Incr_Glob" (SPARK RM 6.1.4(15))
pack.adb:16:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at pack.ads:8 should mention X in a precondition]
