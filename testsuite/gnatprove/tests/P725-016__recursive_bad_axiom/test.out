recursive_through_type.ads:5:13: warning: "Bad_F" is recursive; its contract might not be available on recursive calls from contracts and assertions [contracts-recursive]
recursive_through_type.ads:5:54: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Bad_F" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "Bad_F" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
recursive_through_type.ads:6:12: high: postcondition might fail [provers gave up before completing the proof]
