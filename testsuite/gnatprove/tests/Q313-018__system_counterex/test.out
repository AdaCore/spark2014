incr.adb:3:11: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove X = X'Old + 1 (e.g. when X = -1 and X'Old = 0)
incr.adb:3:21: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition]
incr.adb:6:11: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition]
