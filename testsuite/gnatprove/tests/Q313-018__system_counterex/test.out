incr.adb:3:11: high: postcondition might fail (e.g. when X = 0 and X'Old = 1)
incr.adb:3:21: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X'Old + 1 (e.g. when X'Old = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit SPARK.Big_Integers]
incr.adb:6:11: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X - 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition]
