test.adb:16:62: high: type is unsuitable as a source for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: type Record_A has minimal size 3, but Size was declared as 24; type Record_A might have unused bits that are not modelled in SPARK]
test.adb:17:62: high: type is unsuitable as a target for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: type Boolean has 2 values but has Object_Size 8, which allows 256 possible values; invalid values could result from the unchecked conversion [SPARK RM 13.9]]
