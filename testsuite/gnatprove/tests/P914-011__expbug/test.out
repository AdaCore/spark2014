repr.adb:6:10: info: implicit terminating annotation on "F" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
repr.adb:16:27: info: precondition proved (Trivial: 2 VC)
repr.adb:16:27: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function F or turning it into an expression function]
repr.adb:16:30: medium: float overflow check might fail [reason for check: result of floating-point exponentiation must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at repr.ads:3 should mention Buf in a precondition]
repr.ads:3:11: warning: subprogram "Check" has no effect
