simple.adb:7:18: high: divide by zero might fail (e.g. when N = 3.1415000E+0) [possible fix: add precondition ((N - 3.1415) /= 0) to subprogram at simple.ads:5]
simple.adb:7:18: medium: float overflow check might fail [reason for check: result of floating-point division must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at simple.ads:5 should mention N in a precondition]
