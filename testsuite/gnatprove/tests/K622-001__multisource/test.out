c.ada:10:14: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: call at line 9 should mention X (for argument X) in a postcondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
c.ada:21:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 15 should mention X in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
