pack.adb:5:30: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Col_Count + C (e.g. when C = Positive_Count'Last and Col_Count = 1) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at pack.ads:5 should mention Col_Count and C in a precondition]
