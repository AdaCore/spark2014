affine_cipher.ads:6:40: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for A * Character'Pos (Character'Last) (e.g. when A = -8421505) [reason for check: result of multiplication must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (A * Character'Pos (Character'Last) >= Integer'First) to subprogram at line 3]
affine_cipher.ads:8:32: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Integer'Last - B (e.g. when A = 0 and B = -1) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (B >= 16#7FFF_FFFF# - Integer'Last) to subprogram at line 3]
