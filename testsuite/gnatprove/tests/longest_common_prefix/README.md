This program computes the length of the longest common prefix between two
substrings of a common text. The postcondition of the main function `LCP`
expresses this property. GNATprove proves all checks on this program. This
program was proposed as a formal verification challenge during the [VerifyThis
Verification Competition in 2012](see http://fm2012.verifythis.org/).
