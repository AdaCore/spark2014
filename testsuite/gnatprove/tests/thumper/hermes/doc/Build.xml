  <title>Building Hermes</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build Hermes and its associated documentation and how to
    run the tests. We also describe various issues related to the tool chain in general, such as
    setting up a continuous integration server and the use of style tools and advanced static
    analysis tools. This chapter is intended for Hermes contributors or power users who wish to
    build the system from the source code repository. If you are using a binary distribution you
    can skip this section entirely.</para>

  <para>The README at the top level of the Hermes source tree gives a summary of the steps
    included here. The README is intended as a kind of "quick start" document. The information
    here is a more detailed version of the information in the top level README.</para>

  <para>The tools with specific version numbers shown below are the official tools used by the
    Hermes contributors. Other tools (or other versions of the same tools) may also work.
    Obviously the greater the differences between the tools you attempt to use and those listed
    below the more problems you are likely to encounter.</para>

        <para>The Hermes documentation is written primarily in DocBook. This is an XML format
          and so is readable (and writable) in an ordinary text editor. However, if you want to
          build nicely formatted documentation or benefit from a more advanced editing features,
          you will need a tool chain for processing DocBook. We currently use <ulink
            url="http://oxygenxml.com/">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</ulink> as our primary DocBook editing
          tool.</para>

        <para>We use Jenkins as our continuous integration system. Our practice is to run
          Jenkins from the <ulink url="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</ulink> application
          server. You do not need to set up Jenkins if you are a single developer.
