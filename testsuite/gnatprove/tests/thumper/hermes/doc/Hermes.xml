    <para>Hermes is an ASN.1 library written in SPARK 2014. It is intended to support other
      projects that have a need for a robust and highly reliable ASN.1 layer. It is also
      intended to showcase SPARK.</para>

    <para>In theory one might prefer a compiler that takes the high level ASN.1 notation and
      compiles it into efficient low level code. In the spirit of Hermes, however, such a
      compiler would have to generate provable SPARK. To my knowledge no such ASN.1 compiler
      exists or is planned. It might be a valuable long term goal for Hermes to one day provide
      such a compiler.</para>

    <para>Hermes is the name of the Greek god of "transitions and boundaries." He was a
      messenger of the gods, playing a role in the communication between the mortal world and
      the divine world. This library is named in his honor.</para>
