    <para>Thumper is an implementation of the RFC-3161 secure time stamping service. The client
      is used to request time stamps for documents provided as files, and can also verify those
      time stamps. The server, running as a trusted third party, is used to create time stamps
      with cryptographic assurance of validity.</para>

    <para>The primary purpose of Thumper is as a SPARK technology demonstration and as an
      educational vehicle for the exploration of high integrity programming techniques.
      Thumper is implemented in the SPARK 2014 language and requires SPARK GPL 2015.</para>
