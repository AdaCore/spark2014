gp_exp.adb:1:11: warning: subprogram "Gp_Exp" has no effect
gp_exp.adb:5:11: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for 2 ** X [reason for check: result of exponentiation must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (2 ** X in Integer) to subprogram at line 1]
gp_exp.adb:5:14: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X [reason for check: exponent value must fit in type Natural] [possible fix: add precondition (X in Natural) to subprogram at line 1]
gp_exp.adb:6:11: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X ** 2 [reason for check: result of exponentiation must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (X ** 2 in Integer) to subprogram at line 1]
gp_exp.adb:7:11: medium: float overflow check might fail [reason for check: result of floating-point exponentiation must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention Y in a precondition]
