logging.adb:16:30: info: range check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
logging.adb:20:16: high: types used for unchecked conversion do not have the same size [possible explanation: type Byte_Array doesn't have an Object_Size representation clause or aspect]
logging.adb:21:20: high: type with holes is unsuitable for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: can't determine size for unconstrained array type Byte_Array]
logging.adb:22:20: high: type with constraints on bit representation is unsuitable for unchecked conversion [possible explanation: bounds of type Payload_As_String_T are not known at compile time]
