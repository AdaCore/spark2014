Replay removes the obsolete proofattempts in manual proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:7:06: info: data dependencies proved
math_euclid.ads:9:14: medium: postcondition might fail
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: medium: range check might fail
Now launching gnatprove in normal mode; it should reuse the proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:7:06: info: data dependencies proved
math_euclid.ads:9:14: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove Divides (X, A mod B) (e.g. when A = 17 and B = 6 and X = 2)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: range check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
