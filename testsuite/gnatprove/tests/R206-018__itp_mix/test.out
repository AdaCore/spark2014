Replay removes the obsolete proofattempts in manual proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:7:06: info: data dependencies proved
math_euclid.ads:9:14: info: postcondition proved (CVC4: 6 VC; Z3: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: range check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
Now launching gnatprove in normal mode; it should reuse the proof:
math_euclid.ads:3:63: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:7:06: info: data dependencies proved
math_euclid.ads:9:14: info: postcondition proved (CVC4: 6 VC; Z3: 1 VC)
math_euclid.ads:9:28: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
