arith.adb:21:23: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X(J) + Y(J) (e.g. when J = 1 and X = (others => -1073741825) and Y = (others => -1073741825)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at arith.ads:15 should mention X and Y in a precondition] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
