arith.adb:21:23: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X(J) + Y(J) (e.g. when J = 1 and X = (1 => Integer'First, others => -1) and Y = (1 => -1, others => Integer'First)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at arith.ads:15 should mention X and Y in a precondition]
