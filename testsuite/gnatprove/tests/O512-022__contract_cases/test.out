p.ads:12:14: high: postcondition might fail (e.g. when Threshold = -1 and X = 0 and X'Old = 0)
p.ads:12:37: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X'Old + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit Ada.Numerics.Big_Numerics.Big_Integers]
