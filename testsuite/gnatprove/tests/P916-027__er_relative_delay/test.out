main.adb:2:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Zero" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
main.adb:5:14: medium: divide by zero might fail [provers gave up before completing the proof]
main.adb:5:14: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for One / Zero [reason for check: result of fixed-point division must fit in the underlying 64-bits machine integer] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
