protected_sequence.adb:22:26: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for (Local + 1) (e.g. when Local = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: loop at line 21 should mention Local in a loop invariant]
protected_sequence.adb:22:31: info: division check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
protected_sequence.ads:11:17: medium: ceiling priority protocol might not be respected for "Protected_Sequence.P1" (e.g. when Value = 0) [reason for check: ceiling priority of the protected object "Protected_Sequence.P1" must be >= the priority of the caller "Protected_Sequence.P2.Set" in the call "Protected_Sequence.P2.Set" -> "Protected_Sequence.P1.Set"]
protected_sequence.ads:14:14: info: ceiling priority protocol is respected for "Protected_Sequence.P2" (CVC5: 1 VC)
