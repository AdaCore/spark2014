protected_sequence.adb:22:26: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Local + 1 (e.g. when Local = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: loop at line 21 should mention Local in a loop invariant]
protected_sequence.adb:22:31: info: division check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
protected_sequence.ads:11:17: medium: ceiling priority protocol might not be respected (e.g. when Value = 0)
