counterex.adb:3:11: high: postcondition might fail (e.g. when V = 300)
counterex.adb:4:13: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V + 10 (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit SPARK.Big_Integers]
counterex.adb:13:17: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V + 10 (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention V in a precondition]
