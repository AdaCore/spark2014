counterex.adb:3:11: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove V =  V + 10 (e.g. when V = 300) [possible explanation: subprogram at line 1 should mention V in a precondition]
counterex.adb:4:13: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [possible explanation: subprogram at line 1 should mention V in a precondition]
counterex.adb:13:17: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when V = 2147483638)
counterexample expected for check at counterex.adb:3
