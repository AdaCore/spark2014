counterex.adb:3:11: medium: postcondition might fail, cannot prove V =  V + 10 (e.g. when V = 300)
counterex.adb:4:13: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]
counterex.adb:13:17: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible explanation: subprogram at line 1 should mention V in a precondition]
