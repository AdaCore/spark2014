counterex.adb:3:11: medium: postcondition might fail (e.g. when V = -291)
counterex.adb:4:13: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V + 10 (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]
counterex.adb:13:17: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V + 10 (e.g. when V = 2147483638) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention V in a precondition]

  trace at counterex.adb:1 --> V = -301
