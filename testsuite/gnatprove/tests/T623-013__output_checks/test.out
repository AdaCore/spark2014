default command-line output
---------------------------

brief output
------------
incr.adb:3:11: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1

pretty output
-------------

incr.adb:3:11: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1
    3 |   X := X + 1;

one-line output
---------------
incr.adb:3:11: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition]
