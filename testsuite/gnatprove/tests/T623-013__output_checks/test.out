brief output
------------
incr.adb:3:11: medium: overflow check might fail

pretty output
-------------

incr.adb:3:11: medium: overflow check might fail
    3 |   X := X + 1;
      |        ~~^~~
  e.g. when X = Integer'Last

  possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition
    1 |procedure Incr (X : in out Integer) is
      |^ here

one-line output
---------------
incr.adb:3:11: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at line 1 should mention X in a precondition]
