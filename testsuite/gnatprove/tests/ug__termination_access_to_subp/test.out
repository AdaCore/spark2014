      + reason for check: procedure "P_Term" has an Always_Terminates aspect
      + possible explanation: calls via access-to-subprograms inside function taken as access might hide recursive calls

 medium: aspect Always_Terminates on "P_Term" could be incorrect, call via access-to-procedure might be nonterminating
