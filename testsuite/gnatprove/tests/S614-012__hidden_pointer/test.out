bar.adb:3:11: warning: subprogram "Bar" has no effect
bar.adb:6:07: info: assertion proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
bar.adb:6:13: info: range check proved (CVC5: 4 VC)
bar.adb:6:29: low: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for To_String (A) & To_String (B) [reason for check: result of concatenation must fit in the type of the qualification] [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
