bar.adb:6:07: medium: assertion might fail [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
bar.adb:6:13: medium: range check might fail [reason for check: slice bounds must fit in the underlying array] [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
bar.adb:6:29: low: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for To_String (A) & To_String (B) [reason for check: result of concatenation must fit in the type of the qualification] [possible fix: subprogram at line 3 should mention A and B in a precondition]
