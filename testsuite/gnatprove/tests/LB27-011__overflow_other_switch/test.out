p.adb:1:34: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "P" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
p.adb:5:30: info: loop invariant initialization proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
p.adb:5:30: info: loop invariant preservation proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
p.adb:5:41: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for N ** J [reason for check: result of exponentiation must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit SPARK.Big_Integers]
