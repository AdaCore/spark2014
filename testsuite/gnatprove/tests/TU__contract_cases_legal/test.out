contract_cases_legal.ads:15:19: high: postcondition might fail (e.g. when Threshold = -1 and X = 0 and X'Old = 0) [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
contract_cases_legal.ads:15:42: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X'Old + 1 (e.g. when X'Old = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: use pragma Overflow_Mode or switch -gnato13 or unit SPARK.Big_Integers] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
