error: Elaboration circularity detected
info:
info:    Reason:
info:
info:      unit "p (spec)" depends on its own elaboration
info:
info:    Circularity:
info:
info:      unit "p (spec)" invokes a construct of unit "q (body)" at elaboration time
info:      unit "q (body)" has with clause for unit "p (spec)"
info:
info:    Suggestions:
info:
info:      use the dynamic elaboration model (compiler switch -gnatE)
info:      use detailed invocation information (compiler switch -gnatd_F)
