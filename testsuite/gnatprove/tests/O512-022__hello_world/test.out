after_tax.adb:7:36: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for (Before_Tax * Rate) (e.g. when Before_Tax = 1073741824 and Rate = 2) [reason for check: result of multiplication must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition ((Before_Tax * Rate) in Integer) to subprogram at after_tax.ads:3]

after_tax.ads:3:10: info: implicit terminating annotation on "After_Tax" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
