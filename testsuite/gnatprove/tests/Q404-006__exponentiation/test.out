exponentiate.adb:10:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Pow2" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
exponentiate.adb:16:23: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Exponentiate" could be incorrect, loop might be nonterminating [possible fix: add loop variant in the loop body]
