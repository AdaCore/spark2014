p.adb:37:25: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Sqrt_Von_Neumann_Aux16" could be incorrect, loop might be nonterminating [possible fix: add loop variant in the loop body]
p.adb:39:25: medium: assertion might fail (e.g. when M = 14 and Res = 32769 and Res_G = 32767) [possible fix: loop at line 37 should mention M and Res and Res_G in a loop invariant]
