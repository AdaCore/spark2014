Files result1 and result2 differ
test.adb:4:53: info: overflow check proved (Z3: 1 VC)
test.adb:4:53: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when Z = Integer'Last) [possible explanation: subprogram at line 4 should mention Z in a precondition]
z3-4.4.0: exec of 'z3-4.4.0' failed (No such file or directory)
