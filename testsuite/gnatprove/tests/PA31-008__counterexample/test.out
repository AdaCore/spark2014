r.adb:30:07: info: initialization of "Total_Ones" proved
r.adb:34:22: info: cannot unroll loop (too many loop iterations)
r.adb:35:35: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Total_Ones + Bit_Count_C (D (I)) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: loop at line 34 should mention Total_Ones in a loop invariant]
