q.adb:16:09: medium: discriminant check might fail (e.g. when X = (B => True, A => 0)) [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Change or turning it into an expression function]
q.adb:17:09: medium: discriminant check might fail (e.g. when Y = (B => True, A => 0)) [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Change or turning it into an expression function]
q.ads:11:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Change" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
q.ads:23:14: medium: postcondition might fail (e.g. when X = (B => False, C => True) and Y = (B => False, C => False)) [possible fix: add or complete related loop invariants or postconditions]
