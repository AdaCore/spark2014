main.adb:7:16: warning: "G" is recursive; its implicit contract might not be available on recursive calls from contracts and assertions [contracts-recursive]
main.adb:7:76: medium: postcondition might fail [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
main.adb:13:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" could be incorrect, dispatching call to "G" might be nonterminating [possible explanation: call could hide recursive calls]
main.adb:14:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "G" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
main.adb:16:19: info: overflow check proved (CVC5: 2 VC)
