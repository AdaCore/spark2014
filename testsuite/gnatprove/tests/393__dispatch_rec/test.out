main.adb:7:16: error: "G" might include a recursive call due to a type invariant or subtype predicate, or there might be a cycle in the elaboration of the enclosing unit
main.adb:7:16: error: unsupported recursive subprogram

main.adb:7:76: medium: postcondition might fail
main.adb:13:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" could be incorrect, dispatching call to "G" might be nonterminating [possible explanation: call could hide recursive calls]
main.adb:14:10: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "G" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "G" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
