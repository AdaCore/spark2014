# test the version output of gnatprove.
# Typical output is like this:
#   $ gnatprove --version
#   <gnatprove version>
#   <full-path-to-prover> : <version output for prover>
# Z3 output looks like this:
#   Z3 version <bla> - 64 bit
# We remove:
# - the gnatprove version, which changes too much
# - the prover locations
# - platform (32bits/64bits) in Z3 output

# We remove LD_LIBRARY_PATH which is set by the GNAT compiler dependency.
# In this way we can test if the provers work without this env var.
# ??? os.unsetenv didn't work, so setting to empty string instead

os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = ''
