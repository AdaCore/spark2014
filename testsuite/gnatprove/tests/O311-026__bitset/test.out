foo.adb:12:21: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: result of addition must be a valid index into the array] [possible fix: subprogram at foo.ads:10 should mention A_First and I in a precondition]
foo.adb:12:21: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for A_First + Natural (I / 32) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at foo.ads:10 should mention A_First and I in a precondition]
foo.adb:12:34: info: division check proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
foo.adb:12:34: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for I / 32 (e.g. when I = Word64'Last) [reason for check: result of division must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: subprogram at foo.ads:10 should mention I in a precondition]
