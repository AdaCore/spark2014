p.ads:8:24: medium: range check might fail [provers gave up before completing the proof]
p.ads:11:18: medium: divide by zero might fail [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Zero or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
p.ads:11:18: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for 10 / Zero [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
