three.adb:4:04: high: alignment of overlayed object might not be an integral multiple of alignment of overlaying object [possible explanation: Y doesn't have an Alignment representation clause or aspect] [possible fix: overlaying object should have an Alignment representation clause]

three.adb:8:19: info: assertion proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
three.adb:11:19: medium: assertion might fail (e.g. when Y = -1) [possible fix: add or complete related loop invariants or postconditions]
