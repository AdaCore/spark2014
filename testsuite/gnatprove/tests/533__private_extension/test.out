check_component_default_value.ads:8:27: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Rand (1) [reason for check: default component value must fit in the type] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function "Rand" or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
