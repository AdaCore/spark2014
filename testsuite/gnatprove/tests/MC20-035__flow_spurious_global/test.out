c34014g.adb:49:26: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for IDENT_INT (1) [reason for check: value must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function IDENT_INT or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
