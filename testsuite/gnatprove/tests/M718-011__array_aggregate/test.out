simple.adb:4:54: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Init_Val + 1 (e.g. when Init_Val = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (Init_Val <= Integer'Last - 1) to subprogram at simple.ads:7]
simple.ads:8:17: info: postcondition proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
