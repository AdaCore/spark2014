simple.adb:4:54: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Init_Val + 1 (e.g. when Init_Val = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at simple.ads:7 should mention Init_Val in a precondition]
simple.ads:8:17: info: postcondition proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
simple.ads:8:69: info: overflow check proved (CVC4: 2 VC)
