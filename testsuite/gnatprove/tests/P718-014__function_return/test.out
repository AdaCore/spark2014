ex.adb:6:17: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for I + 1 (e.g. when I = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (I <= Integer'Last - 1) to subprogram at ex.ads:3]
ex.adb:11:14: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + Get_Int (4) (e.g. when X = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at ex.ads:5 should mention X in a precondition]
