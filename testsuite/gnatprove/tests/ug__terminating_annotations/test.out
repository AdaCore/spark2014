terminating_annotations.adb:8:10: medium: aspect Always_Terminates on "P_Rec" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive
    8 |         P_Rec (X - 1);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~
  possible fix: annotate "P_Rec" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect

terminating_annotations.adb:15:19: medium: aspect Always_Terminates on "P_While" could be incorrect, loop might be nonterminating
   15 |      while Y > 0 loop
      |                  ^~~~
  possible fix: add loop variant in the loop body

terminating_annotations.adb:35:07: medium: aspect Always_Terminates on "P_Call" could be incorrect, call to "Not_SPARK" might be nonterminating
   35 |      Not_SPARK (X);
      |      ^~~~~~~~~~~~
  possible fix: annotate "Not_SPARK" with Always_Return
