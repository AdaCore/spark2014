power_14.adb:55:24: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Level_A + Level_B (e.g. when Level_A = Integer'First and Level_B = -1) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: call at line 54 should mention Level (for argument Level_B) in a postcondition]
