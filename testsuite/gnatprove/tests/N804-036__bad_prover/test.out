test.adb:4:53: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove bounds for Z + 1 (e.g. when Z = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (Z <= Integer'Last - 1) to subprogram at line 4]
plop: exec of 'plop' failed (No such file or directory)
