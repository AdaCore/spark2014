out_subcheck.adb:9:07: info: initialization of "X" proved
out_subcheck.adb:11:13: medium: in value of subprogram parameter after the call at out_subcheck.adb:11
out_subcheck.adb:11:13: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X (e.g. when X = 1) [reason for check: output value must fit in argument type] [possible fix: call at line 11 should mention Z (for argument X) in a postcondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
out_subcheck.ads:6:20: info: initialization of "Z" proved
out_subcheck.ads:8:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Read_Validate" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
