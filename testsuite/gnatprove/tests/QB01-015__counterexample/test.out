bytes.adb:5:20: high: array index check might fail (e.g. when A_Record = (id => UInt16'Last-1, length => UInt8'Last, Payload => (others => UInt8'Last)) and output'First = UInt16'Last and output'Last = UInt16'Last-1) [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array]
bytes.ads:14:57: medium: "output" might not be initialized in "To_Byte_Array" [reason for check: OUT parameter should be fully initialized on return] [possible fix: initialize "output" on all paths, make "output" an IN OUT parameter or annotate it with aspect Relaxed_Initialization]
