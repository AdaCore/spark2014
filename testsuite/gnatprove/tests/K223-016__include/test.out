callee.adb:4:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for A + B (e.g. when A = -1 and B = Integer'First) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at callee.ads:2 should mention A and B in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
