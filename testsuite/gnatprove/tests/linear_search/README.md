This program searches for a given value in an unordered array. The
postcondition of the main function `Linear_Search` expresses that if the search
is successful then the index returned is one at which the array contains the
value searched. GNATprove proves all checks on this program. This program is
the same as the one presented in the SPARK Tutorial section of the User's
Guide.
