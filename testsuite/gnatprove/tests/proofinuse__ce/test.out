counter_examples.adb:9:16: medium: float overflow check might fail (e.g. when X = 3.4027717E+38 and Y = -5.1821557E+33) [reason for check: result of floating-point subtraction must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at counter_examples.ads:8 should mention X and Y in a precondition]

counter_examples.adb:19:25: medium: assertion might fail (e.g. when Res = 64 and X = 32) [possible fix: subprogram at counter_examples.ads:11 should mention X in a precondition]
