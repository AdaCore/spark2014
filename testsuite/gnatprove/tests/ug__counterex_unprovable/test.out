   20 |         Result := Result + X;
      |                   ~~~~~~~^~~
  e.g. when Result = Int'First
        and X = -1
  reason for check: result of addition must fit in the target type of the assignment
  possible fix: loop at line 19 should mention Result in a loop invariant
   19 |      while J <= 2 loop

      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
  e.g. when X = 0
        and X'Old = 1
  possible fix: add or complete related loop invariants or postconditions
