pack.adb:4:04: warning: variable "X" is read but never assigned [-gnatwv]
pack.adb:9:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at pack.ads:3 should mention X in a precondition]
