foo.adb:8:33: low: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for "The length of " & ICS.Value(Chr) & " is " & ICS.Strlen(Chr)'Image & ", and that's OK" [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function Strlen or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
