p.adb:8:21: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Integer'Pos (A) (e.g. when A = -129) [possible fix: add precondition (Integer'Pos (A) >= -128) to subprogram at p.ads:3] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
p.ads:3:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Bar_05" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
