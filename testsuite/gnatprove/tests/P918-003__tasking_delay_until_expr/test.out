main.adb:6:27: medium: range check might fail [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
main.adb:6:44: medium: divide by zero might fail [provers gave up before completing the proof]
main.adb:6:44: medium: range check might fail [reason for check: input value must fit in parameter type] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
main2.adb:5:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Div" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
main2.adb:11:16: info: division check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
main2.adb:11:16: medium: range check might fail [reason for check: returned value must fit in the result type of the function] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at line 5 should mention A] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
main2.adb:16:27: medium: range check might fail [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function "Div" or turning it into an expression function] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
