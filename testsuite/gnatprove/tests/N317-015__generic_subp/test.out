opers.adb:7:16: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X + X, in instantiation at opers.adb:10 (e.g. when X = -1073741825) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (if X >= 0 then X <= Integer'Last - X else X >= Integer'First - X) to subprogram at line 10]
