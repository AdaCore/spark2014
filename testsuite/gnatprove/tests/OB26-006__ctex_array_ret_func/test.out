p.adb:9:35: high: range check might fail (e.g. when TC_Items = (others => 0) and TC_Last = 11) [reason for check: slice bounds must fit in the underlying array] [possible fix: subprogram at p.ads:3 should mention TC_Items and TC_Last in a precondition]
p.adb:9:57: high: array index check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for 1 (e.g. when TC_Items = (others => 0) and TC_Last = 0) [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array]
p.ads:3:15: warning: subprogram "Proc" has no effect
