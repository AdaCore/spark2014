p.adb:4:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at p.ads:2 should mention X in a precondition]
p.ads:3:14: info: postcondition proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
p.ads:5:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Add_One" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
p.ads:5:56: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for X + 1 (e.g. when X = Integer'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (X <= Integer'Last - 1) to subprogram at line 5]
