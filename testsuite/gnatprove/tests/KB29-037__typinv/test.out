typeinv.adb:6:14: medium: invariant check might fail, cannot prove Is_Valid (T) (e.g. when X = 1) [possible fix: subprogram at typeinv.ads:4 should mention X in a precondition] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
typeinv.adb:6:17: high: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X (e.g. when X = -1) [reason for check: value must be convertible to the target type of the conversion] [possible fix: add precondition (X >= Integer(T'First)) to subprogram at typeinv.ads:4] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
