repro.adb:11:13: high: alignment of source type of unchecked conversion might not be an integral multiple of alignment of target type [possible explanation: alignment of type "Subarr" (which is 1) must be a multiple of the alignment of type "Integer" (which is 4)] [possible fix: source type of unchecked conversion should have an Alignment representation clause]
repro.adb:11:13: info: types in unchecked conversion have the same size (Trivial)
