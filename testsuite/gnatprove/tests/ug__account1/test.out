 medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Num_Accounts + 1

      |                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
      + reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer
      + possible fix: loop at line 13 should mention Num_Accounts in a loop invariant
