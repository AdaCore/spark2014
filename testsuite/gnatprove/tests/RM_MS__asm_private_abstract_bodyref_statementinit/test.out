stack_14.adb:17:26: medium: range check might fail (e.g. when Pointer = Pointer_Range'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible explanation: subprogram at stack_14.ads:6 should mention Pointer in a precondition]

stack_14.adb:26:15: medium: array index check might fail [reason for check: value must be a valid index into the array] [possible explanation: subprogram at stack_14.ads:9 should mention Pointer in a precondition]
