stack_14.adb:17:26: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Pointer + 1 (e.g. when Pointer = Pointer_Range'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: subprogram at stack_14.ads:6 should mention Pointer in a precondition]
