bug.ads:21:54: medium: range check might fail (e.g. when A'First = 0 and A'Last = -1) [reason for check: slice bounds must fit in the underlying array] [possible fix: precondition of subprogram at line 16 should mention A]
bug.ads:21:64: medium: overflow check might fail (e.g. when A = (Positive'Last => 0) and A'First = Integer'Last and A'Last = Integer'Last and I = 0 and Size_B = 0) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer]
