ghost_illegal_2.adb: Vol_Ghost is both a volatile and a ghost variable.
                     This should not be allowed.

                     No error is emitted for reading a volatile while from
                     within a ghost function.

                     Function Return_First_Int emits no error. Is this OK
                     since it's an instantiation of generic function rather
                     than a generic package?
