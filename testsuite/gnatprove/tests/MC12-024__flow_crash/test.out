p.adb:31:28: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Full_S.A + X [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: subprogram at p.ads:30 should mention Full_S and Raw_S and X in a precondition]
p.adb:32:28: medium: float overflow check might fail [reason for check: result of floating-point addition must be bounded] [possible fix: subprogram at p.ads:30 should mention Full_S and Raw_S and Y in a precondition]
