p.adb:6:17: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for V + 1 [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: loop at line 5 should mention V in a loop invariant]
p.ads:3:14: info: nontermination of task proved (CVC4: 1 VC)
p1.ads:5:04: high: possible data race when accessing variable "p.v"
p1.ads:5:04: high: task "p1.t" accesses "p.v"
p1.ads:5:04: high: task "p2.t" accesses "p.v"
