c86004c01.adb:6:25: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for STANDARD.C86004C0(10) [reason for check: default component value must fit in the type] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function C86004C0 or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
