simple.adb:7:22: medium: assertion might fail [possible fix: subprogram at simple.ads:13 should mention Alice and Bob in a precondition]
simple.adb:8:24: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Alice.Age + Bob.Age (e.g. when Alice = (Age => 79, Height => 1310359911, Name => "VP") and Bob = (Age => 110, Height => 102129283, Name => "xY")) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 8-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (Alice.Age <= 127 - Bob.Age) to subprogram at simple.ads:13]
simple.adb:8:24: high: range check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for Alice.Age + Bob.Age (e.g. when Alice = (Age => 79, Height => 1310359911, Name => "VP") and Bob = (Age => 110, Height => 102129283, Name => "xY")) [reason for check: returned value must fit in the result type of the function] [possible fix: add precondition (Alice.Age <= Lifetime'Last - Bob.Age) to subprogram at simple.ads:13]
