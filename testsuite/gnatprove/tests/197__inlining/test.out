iter.adb:5:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Get" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
iter.adb:5:18: warning: unused initial value of "I"
iter.adb:8:09: warning: unused assignment
iter.adb:8:14: high: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for I + 1 (e.g. when I = Positive'Last) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (I <= Integer'Last - 1) to subprogram at line 5] [provers gave up before completing the proof]
iter.adb:12:39: info: no contextual analysis of "Get" (in potentially unevaluated context)
