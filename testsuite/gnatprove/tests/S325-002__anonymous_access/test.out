base_repr.adb:9:13: warning: "Length" is recursive; its implicit contract might not be available on recursive calls from contracts and assertions [contracts-recursive]
base_repr.adb:10:07: medium: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Length" could be incorrect, subprogram is recursive [possible fix: annotate "Length" with a Subprogram_Variant aspect]
base_repr.adb:11:14: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove upper bound for 1 + Length (L.N) [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: add precondition (1 <= Integer'Last - Length (L.N)) to subprogram at line 9] [provers reached step limit before completing the proof]
base_repr.adb:11:25: info: pointer dereference check proved (CVC5: 1 VC)
