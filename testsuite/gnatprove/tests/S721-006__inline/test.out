bindo.adb:27:07: medium: pointer dereference check might fail (e.g. when G = null) [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G in a precondition]
bindo.adb:27:16: medium: pointer dereference check might fail (e.g. when G = null) [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G in a precondition]
bindo.adb:27:22: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for Count - 1 [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G and Kind in a precondition]
