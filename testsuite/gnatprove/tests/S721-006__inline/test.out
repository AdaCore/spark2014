bindo.adb:7:13: info: implicit aspect Always_Terminates on "Kind" has been proved, subprogram will terminate
bindo.adb:27:08: medium: pointer dereference check might fail (e.g. when G = null) [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G in a precondition]
bindo.adb:27:27: medium: pointer dereference check might fail (e.g. when G = null) [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G in a precondition]
bindo.adb:27:42: medium: range check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for G.Counts (Kind) - 1 (e.g. when G.all = (Counts => (No_Edge => 0)) and Kind = No_Edge) [reason for check: result of subtraction must fit in the target type of the assignment] [possible fix: subprogram at line 20 should mention G and Kind in a precondition]
