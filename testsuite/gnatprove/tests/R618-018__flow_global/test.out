p1.adb:10:14: high: "X1" constituent of "S1" must be listed in the Global aspect of "F1" (SPARK RM 6.1.4(15))
p1.adb:10:17: medium: overflow check might fail, cannot prove lower bound for X1 + P1.P2.F2 [reason for check: result of addition must fit in a 32-bits machine integer] [possible fix: you should consider adding a postcondition to function F2 or turning it into an expression function in its unit spec]
